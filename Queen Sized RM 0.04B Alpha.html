These settings will be used all throughout the game and will affect the content that you will see, so please make sure you choose your options wisely as we wouldn’t want you to see anything you might otherwise not want to see.  

The first option that you will decide on is if you want slob content in your game to and to what extent. Full is the default and includes sweat, food stains, burping, body hair and sweat/cum stains. Partial is the middle ground with it including everything except body hair. None is exactly as it sounds, however there will still be mentions of sweat where it would be necessary, such as if a character is physically exerting themselves. These options also affect some mechanics in the game, if you have it on full you will, or I should say can, shave and bathe, on partial you can just bathe and on none you won’t be able to interact with these mechanics.   

&lt;&lt;listbox &quot;$slobOp&quot; autoselect&gt;&gt; 
	&lt;&lt;option &quot;Full&quot; &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;option &quot;Partial&quot;&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;option &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/listbox&gt;&gt; WIP, only Partial and Full work rigth now

The second option you’ll need to answer is if you want to turn on the furry mode. If you have furry mode on it will affect most characters turning them into various non-human races, except for ones that already aren’t human and it won’t affect the player. The default is off.

&lt;&lt;listbox &quot;$furryM&quot; autoselect&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;option &quot;Off&quot; &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;option &quot;On&quot;&gt;&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Name" tags="" position="1000,800" size="100,100">A name is the most important aspect of a person, it gives people something to attach all your other traits to, it can be a source of pride or dread or even embarrassment for its owner, but also the people who you rule over. Pick a name that is worthy of your legacy, whatever it might be. So, what is your name, your highness? 

&lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$player.name&quot; &quot;Sasha&quot;&gt;&gt;

While a race isn’t really something that sets in stone your outcome in life it most certainly adds a flare to your presence. While some might prefer a human over a Dragon-folk, or maybe an elf over a Wolf-walker, it&#39;s all up to personal tastes and has no real effect on anything other than appearances. So, pick your race as you see fit.

How tall are you? Height might seem a trivial thing, but you’d be surprised how many people like it! Er, I mean, as the ruling figure of a kingdom your stature can be a useful factor in intimidation or uploading a strong appearance, or it can be a source of mockery and seen as weak or powerless. It really depends on your actions more than anything though.

A person&#39;s body shape can lead to all sorts of interesting happenings, whether it be ripping through pairs of pants or bursting off bras, a body shape affects all of those fun things. Your body shape can make an extra bit of weight look sexy and appealing when added to your thighs and rear, or to your bust, or to your belly, or to your arms, or face, or back, or, you get the idea, an extra bit of weight looks sexy in general. I guess the point is, it’s up to preference.

Your kingdom is fairly average compared to other kingdoms around in size, development and population. Right now your kingdom has around 50,000 people living in it, most live out in villages or towns, working the land and living modest lives. The two small cities your kingdom has are developed and are hubs for farmers selling their goods as well as merchants and small business owners. Taxes from business and people provide you with more than enough to cover the costs of running everything and leaves you with a nice amount of excess to fill your pockets with. Does this sound like the kingdom you’re from? 
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Your kingdom is extremely developed compared to other kingdoms. In size it&#39;s fairly similar, but in development and population it far exceeds its counterparts. Right now your kingdom has around 80,000 people living in it, most of them live out in cozy farming villages or towns, but a growing number has moved to the cities to be artisans, merchants or even scholars. The two cities in your kingdom are busy hubs of commercial activity, which has led to large business operating from these cities, which has in turn led to more business revenue and, for you, more business tax money. Taxes from business and people provide you with more than enough to cover the costs of running everything and leaves you with a generous fortune to fill your pockets with. Does this sound like the kingdom you’re from?  
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
Your kingdom is very developed compared to other kingdoms. In size it&#39;s fairly similar, but in development and population it far exceeds its counterparts. Right now your kingdom has around 75,000 people living in it, most of them live out in cozy farming villages or towns. This group of people has expanded in recent years and has led to the recent population boom. The two cities in your kingdom are busy hubs of commercial activity, which has led to a few large businesses starting to operate from these cities, which has in turn led to more business revenue and, for you, more business tax money. Taxes from business and people provide you with more than enough to cover the costs of running everything and leaves you with a generous amount to fill your pockets with. Does this sound like the kingdom you’re from?
&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;
Your kingdom is less than average compared to other kingdoms around development and population. Right now your kingdom has around 40,000 people living in it, most live out in villages or towns, they work the land and struggle to live even modest lives. The two small cities your kingdom has are somewhat developed and are hubs for farmers selling their goods as well as merchants and some small business owners. Taxes from business and people provide you with just enough to cover the costs of running everything and leaves you with a small amount of excess to line your pockets with. Does this sound like the kingdom you’re from? 
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;
Your kingdom is a backwater compared to the kingdoms that surround it. In size it&#39;s about the same but in development and it is way behind the others. Right now your kingdom has around 35,000 people struggling to live in it, most of them live out in ramshackle villages or towns, they toil on the fields, struggling to feed their family or farm enough to sell at the markets. The one city in your kingdom is the only place that is somewhat developed. All the richest business owners, landowners and merchants live there. It is the only place where life doesn’t struggle to survive. Taxes from what few businesses and the wretched populace is barely able to pay for upkeep, and sometimes it isn’t able to at all, leaving you with little, if any, money to put into your own empty pockets.

The sounds of far off birds drift to your attention, shortly followed by the sounds of hustle and bustle people in the courtyard down below.  You lay in bed looking at your ceiling for a few moments, you feel like something important is happening today, but what? Suddenly you remember: Your parents are returning.

Taking a quick glance at the mirror you see your trim body, perfect locks of hair and flawless $player.color1 skin. You can’t help but smirk, most women would die to have a body like yours, or at the very least work their asses off to maintain a body like yours. Deciding to more closely examine your beauty you take a step forward, after all, someone of your beauty has to be carefully studied, even if you&#39;re the one doing the studying. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your face is sharp, not an ounce of unwanted fat inhabits your face. Your lips are full, your cheekbones are high and quite prominent. The skin of your face is perfect; no acne, blemishes or freckles can be found on your face. Your impeccable face is framed by your perfect and smooth locks of $player.color2 hair.

You slide your eyes downwards. Your neck is thin and well defined, it trails down to your well defined shoulders and upper chest. Your shoulders lead down to well defined arms. Bringing your eyes back towards your chest you’re met by your breasts. They comfortably fill your bra and provide you with a decent amount of cleavage. While they aren’t the largest breasts they make up for it with perknes and shape. 

Just below your breasts is your trim midsection. You can see the faint outline of abs on your midsection. Your sides are tight and follow your ribs tightly, giving you a slim waist. You can’t help but smile, your midsection is your pride and joy. Your average breasts and rear combined with your trim body make you extremely attractive, not to mention sexy. 

Speaking of your rear you haven’t given it a proper look over. Your hips are about as wide as you&#39;d expect for a woman of your size; about the same width as your shoulders. Your thighs are thin and muscular, a sizable gap separates them. You turn slightly to get a look at your rear. It&#39;s fairly modest, it has a rounded shape and is noticeable, it&#39;s just muscle covered by a thin layer of fat. Overall though it’s quite a nice lower body.

You smile as you turn back around, god you&#39;re good looking you murmur to yourself. You’ve always had a charm to you, plus your natural beauty, made it possible for you to always slip out of your studies as a child. I mean who needs to read when you can get anything you want with a wink and a smile?

Taking a quick glance at the mirror you see your trim body, perfect horns and flawless $player.color1 scales that seem to glow. You can’t help but smirk, most women would die to have a body like yours, even some other Dragon-folk women you’ve interacted with look at your body with a touch of envy and jealousy, especially once their mates started to eye you up. Deciding to more closely examine your beauty you take a step forward, after all, a Dragon-folk of your beauty has to be carefully studied, even if you&#39;re the one doing the studying. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your face is sharp, not an ounce of unwanted fat inhabits your face. Your lips are full, your cheekbones are high and quite prominent. The scales on your face are perfect and shiny, every one of them is perfectly shaped as well as vibrantly colored. Your impeccable face is framed by your perfect and grand horns that give you an air of authority; like a crown given to you by nature.

You let your eyes wander downwards, past your thin neck and narrow shoulders. They stop just at the starts of your cleavage. The purple bra you wear does wonders for your small, perky breasts. It pushes them together and upwards, artificially deepening your cleavage, or at least gives the perception of a deeper cleavage and the illusion of a larger bosom. While your bosom still leaves much to be desired, your tight, flat tummy easily makes up for your breasts shortcomings, plus your naturally narrow shoulders further helps hide how small they are.

You sigh, tiring of looking at your upper body’s lackluster features you slide your gaze downwards to your pelvic region. Your eyes are immediately drawn to your wide hips and thick powerful thighs. Your hips are perfectly padded, wide and juicy. Your thighs are mostly muscle, but you do have a good decent amount of fat coating them. You turn slightly so you can have a look at your illustrious rear. You have a nice bubble butt that has a good jiggle and fills out the rear of your dresses. You take a moment to also appreciate your thick and muscular tail as well your gradious wings.

Before getting dressed you decided to take a moment to inspect yourself in the mirror. The first thing that catches your eye are your horns. They’ve always been eye-catching; they’re thick and tall, like a crown given to you by nature. Your horns are the only part of you, besides your chest. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, your  $player.color1 scales for the most part are clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most they&#39;re shiny and new looking. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Looking downwards at your chest you can’t help but crack a smile at the sight of your full bosom. Your breasts are large to say the least. Each one easily fills one of your hands. Your purple bra struggles to retain your bosom, breast fat oozes over the rim of your bra cups. Your cleavage is deep and due to how your breasts are squeezed into a bra that is a tad too small for them your cleavage is very well defined. 

Below your breasts is your plain midsection. It’s fairly flat as it only has enough padding to hide your ribs and make it soft to the touch. You have an average stomach overall, so, there isn’t much to really describe.  

Looking down you see your hips, they’re about as wide as they should be for a woman of your size and age. Much the same can be said about your thighs. Turning around to have a look at your ass you find that it&#39;s exactly what you expected it to be. It sticks out a bit, but not enough to be of any particularly notable size. Just above your simple ass is your tail, it’s fairly thick and the scales on it are vibrant and new looking, but for a Dragon-folkis of your age it&#39;s, well, average. Looking up at your back you see your wings, which, just like your tail are average so you don’t even bother giving them a once over.

Turning back to face the mirror you give yourself one last quick once over. Overall you&#39;re fairly average, you have a bit more top then most women, but you’re lacking in the rear compared to most women so it evens out. Though, you can’t help but smile thinking about your superior mental capabilities.

Looking at your chest you’re only met by mild disappointment. Your meager breasts barely manage to fill your bra. Their only saving grace is that their perky, though, it’s to be expected given how small they are. Supporting your below average boobs is your very average stomach. It&#39;s not entirely flat as a little bit of chub gives it a nice bit of padding. While no one would mistake you as being overweight or chubby, your tummy certainly wouldn’t be considered skinny. Even in your mid section you’re of average build. You’ve always been just average, as a kid you always tried to stick out by reading or learning, which, in turn, has made your intellect above average. 

Returning back to reality you let your eyes move downwards towards your lower body. While you’re mostly on the average side of things, your lower body however is anything but average. Your hips are wide and full, your thighs are thick and your ass is dress filling. Your thighs touch slightly, but leave a thigh gap just below your groin, though, it&#39;s more of a thigh window rather than a gap. You turn slightly to have a better look at your rear. Your royal purple underwear cling tight to your padded ass, reaching back to give your ass a slap and watch as it jiggles before it settles down. You also take the time to admire your thick tail and elegant wings.   

Turning back to face the mirror you give yourself one last quick once over. Overall you&#39;re fairly average, you have a bit more bottom then most women, but you’re lacking in the chest compared to most women so it evens out. Though, you can’t help but smile thinking about your superior mental capabilities.   

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decided to take a moment to inspect yourself in the mirror. The first thing that catches your eyes is your $player.color2 hair. It’s always been eye-catching; it&#39;s smooth, shiny and pretty much flawless. Your hair is the only part of you, besides your lower body. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, well, by elven standards, your $player.color1 skin for the most part is clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most it&#39;s clear. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Looking at your chest you’re only met by mild disappointment. Your meager breasts barely manage to fill your bra. Their only saving grace is that their perky, though, it’s to be expected given how small they are. Supporting your below average boobs is your very average stomach. It&#39;s not entirely flat as a little bit of chub gives it a nice bit of padding. While no one would mistake you as being overweight or chubby, your tummy certainly wouldn’t be considered skinny. Even in your mid section you’re of average build. You’ve always been just average, as a kid you always tried to stick out by reading or learning, which, in turn, has made your intellect above average. 

Returning back to reality you let your eyes move downwards towards your lower body. While you’re mostly on the average side of things, your lower body however is anything but average.

	Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of royal lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your upper body like your breasts. Your belly and love handles are also pretty sizable, and your hips, thighs and ass have the lowest amount of fat on them, although your thighs are still pretty well padded. 

	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne, especially when that heir can turn you to ashes if she so wished. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard. 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Your eyes come to your soft shoulders, as your eyes move over their outline your eyes catch the deep dip in the soft flesh of your shoulder caused by your bra straps holding up their burden worthy of Atlas. Following the curve of your shoulder further down you eventually come to your flabby upper arm that hasn’t seen a hard day&#39;s work ever. You raise your arm out to your side, which really isn’t a super easy task. You watch as the fat flesh of your arm dangles down, giveing you a nice pair of fatty, embarrassing, useless wings. Reliving your weak muscles you let your arms down and move your gaze to inspect your forearms. Just like with your upper arms your forearms are covered in a thick layer of lard and lack any sort of muscles underneath. Your blueberry forearms taper down to your fat wrist, which is about as thick as a normal woman&#39;s forearm, which then leads to your pudgy, piggy hand. Your hands are nothing like the nimble, slender, dextrous penny-counter hands that one might expect from a future leader, instead they are the hands of an overfed pig, or maybe a bloated tyrant. Your fingers are round with fat, like sausages that have been overfilled, making them almost completely useless for anything other than stuffing yourself. 

Redirecting your gaze to your chest you see your massive bosom that could crush a weak table if you were to rest them down on the table too hard, or easily rip a normal bra to shards. Speaking of bras, your bra is absolutely gigantic, when you’re not wearing it you could easily mistake it for a childs dress or maybe a very petite womens dress. The fabric at one point was a vibrant purple but after months of abuse the color has faded to more of a dull purple that&#39;s covered in grease and sweat stains. The underboob and armpit areas of your bra are almost always visibly damp. The upper parts of the bra, including the rim, have been stained by grease and sauce stains from your many feasts. Your cleavage is deep, more than deep enough to bury a man&#39;s head, though with your lack of hygiene he might find it to be a greasy, crumb ridden cavaron of disgust, or bliss depending on if he&#39;s a freak or not. The tops of your breasts fare no better with crumbs, smudges of sauce or puddles of grease littering the surface of your massive calcium howitzers. 

Helping your bra in its atlantean task of holding up your breasts is your rather large belly whose sole purpose is to digest food and support your milk-silos. Your bell is one big flabby roll that for the most part is pretty perky, though at your size it does have a bit of sag to it, it is unavoidable after all. Due to the overhang of your breasts your belly for the most part escapes any crumbs or grease that might avoid your hungry maw, however it insead acts as a drip tray for any grease that your breasts fail to capture. Your belly button is a deep, damp hole that you often use to aid with self pleasure, especially considering that reaching your nethers is not exactly an easy task, along with reaching your own nipples. Your belly just barely covers your fupa, but other than that it leaves your lower body alone for the most part. 

Lifting up your belly and lifting it only a few inches is a task that requires a level of fitness you simply don’t have. Your muscles burn and scream as you struggle to lift it up a few inches, though you&#39;re almost lifting up your bosom in the process, which would explain the extra weight. You feel the cool air on your underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp with arousal. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, too bad there&#39;s no one to use it. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun.  

Letting your belly go, it flops down, hitting into your fupa, giving you an unexpected burst of pleasure. Regaining your senses, you look down at your thighs and see how thick they are, touching all the way down to just above your knees. You guess this makes sense as with how much weight is in your upper body you need a counter balance. The thickness of your thighs causes you to have a slight waddle as you struggle to get the thick, cellulite ridden tubes of lard to stubbornly slide past each other. Glancing up towards you see how your belly, or more specifically, your handles overhang your hips, hiding the waistband of your panties in its subsequent sweaty crevasse.

As your eyes follow your thick love handle you start to rotate your body, turning your back towards the mirror. Your back is a full blown bakery! On your upper back you see the strap of your bra dug in stubbornly into the rolls of your back; flesh oozing over and around it, trying to either pop it off or drown it. On your upper back as well, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up.Below your bra your love handles come together and arc upwards at the center of your back. Giving you two thick back rolls that stretch from your mid back down and round to your hips, flaring outwards in the process. 

A little above your ass is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Looking down from your tail and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned and considering the fact that you&#39;re an elf, a race known for being elegant, slim and beautiful. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of royal elf lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your upper body like your breasts. Your belly and love handles are also pretty sizable, and your hips, thighs and ass have the lowest amount of fat on them, although your thighs are still pretty well padded. 

	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so grotesquely obese. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge on an elvish child was a call for concern. As this behavior continued to spiral out of control and you started to turn more and more into a fat, uncivilized pig your parents took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. You always took some pride in watching your parents squirm whenever they’d see it, you could always see the disdain in their eyes and you loved it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it anyways, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, especially your parents, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. This is something you take an odd pride in, considering that most elves have perfect, flawless skin, and here you are a disgusting slob; one of a kind. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.

Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings.

Your hands are nothing like the nimble, slender, dextrous penny-counter hands that one might expect from a future leader, instead they are the hands of an overfed pig, or maybe a bloated tyrant. Your fingers are round with fat, like sausages that have been overfilled, making them almost completely useless for anything other than stuffing yourself. 

Redirecting your gaze to your chest you see your massive bosom that could crush a weak table if you were to rest them down on the table too hard, or easily rip a normal bra to shards. Speaking of bras, your bra is absolutely gigantic, when you’re not wearing it you could easily mistake it for a childs dress or maybe a very petite womens dress. The fabric at one point was a vibrant purple but after months of abuse the color has faded to more of a dull purple that&#39;s covered in grease and sweat stains. The underboob and armpit areas of your bra are almost always visibly damp. The upper parts of the bra, including the rim, have been stained by grease and sauce stains from your many feasts. Your cleavage is deep, more than deep enough to bury a man&#39;s head, though with your lack of hygiene he might find it to be a greasy, crumb ridden cavaron of disgust, or bliss depending on if he&#39;s a freak or not. The tops of your breasts fare no better with crumbs, smudges of sauce or puddles of grease littering the surface of your massive calcium howitzers. 

Helping your bra in its atlantean task of holding up your breasts is your rather large belly whose sole purpose is to digest food and support your milk-silos. Your bell is one big flabby roll that for the most part is pretty perky, though at your size it does have a bit of sag to it, it is unavoidable after all. Due to the overhang of your breasts your belly for the most part escapes any crumbs or grease that might avoid your hungry maw, however it insead acts as a drip tray for any grease that your breasts fail to capture. Your belly button is a deep, damp hole that you often use to aid with self pleasure, especially considering that reaching your nethers is not exactly an easy task, along with reaching your own nipples. Your belly just barely covers your fupa, but other than that it leaves your lower body alone for the most part. 

Lifting up your belly and lifting it only a few inches is a task that requires a level of fitness you simply don’t have. Your muscles burn and scream as you struggle to lift it up a few inches, though you&#39;re almost lifting up your bosom in the process, which would explain the extra weight. You feel the cool air on your underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp with arousal. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, too bad there&#39;s no one to use it. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun.  

Letting your belly go, it flops down, hitting into your fupa, giving you an unexpected burst of pleasure. Regaining your senses, you look down at your thighs and see how thick they are, touching all the way down to just above your knees. You guess this makes sense as with how much weight is in your upper body you need a counter balance. The thickness of your thighs causes you to have a slight waddle as you struggle to get the thick, cellulite ridden tubes of lard to stubbornly slide past each other. Glancing up towards you see how your belly, or more specifically, your handles overhang your hips, hiding the waistband of your panties in its subsequent sweaty crevasse.

As your eyes follow your thick love handle you start to rotate your body, turning your back towards the mirror. Your back is a full blown bakery! On your upper back you see the strap of your bra dug in stubbornly into the rolls of your back; flesh oozing over and around it, trying to either pop it off or drown it. Below your bra your love handles come together and arc upwards at the center of your back. Giving you two thick back rolls that stretch from your mid back down and round to your hips, flaring outwards in the process. Just below these rolls you see your pudgy tail sticking out just above your ass.  

Looking down from your back and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of royal lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your upper body like your breasts. Your belly and love handles are also pretty sizable, and your hips, thighs and ass have the lowest amount of fat on them, although your thighs are still pretty well padded. 

	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard. 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.

Your eyes come to your soft shoulders, as your eyes move over their outline your eyes catch the deep dip in the soft flesh of your shoulder caused by your bra straps holding up their burden worthy of Atlas. Following the curve of your shoulder further down you eventually come to your flabby upper arm that hasn’t seen a hard day&#39;s work ever. You raise your arm out to your side, which really isn’t a super easy task. You watch as the fat flesh of your arm dangles down, giveing you a nice pair of fatty, embarrassing, useless wings. Reliving your weak muscles you let your arms down and move your gaze to inspect your forearms. Just like with your upper arms your forearms are covered in a thick layer of lard and lack any sort of muscles underneath. Your blueberry forearms taper down to your fat wrist, which is about as thick as a normal woman&#39;s forearm, which then leads to your pudgy, piggy hand.

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Your bosom is of a decent size compared to your girth. Your breasts rest on top of your apron of a gut, they stick out about half of the distance that your fat belly does. The bra your breasts fill is covered in grease and food stains, markings of prior feasts. The cavern of your cleavage isn’t much better. Deep in its depths grease covered crumbs have been buried, the tops on your breasts tell a similar story with crumbs, spots of sauce and grease littering their soft, squishy flesh. 

Below your bosom is your massive apron of a gut, really apron is too small of a turn, it&#39;s more like a great fleshy gate that seals away your royal fupa and aristocratic thighs. Your belly is one massive roll that is surprisingly perky given its size. Your belly button is a deep damp hole located somewhere on your gut, the location is of no value to you ever since you became unable to reach the front of your globular gut. Your belly sags down to your mid thigh, hiding everything underneath, creating a sweaty fold that rarely sees the light of day unless you&#39;re pawing desperately at your needy sex. Your belly is covered in a constant shine of grease. To either side of your flabby gut is a thick love handle that juts out past your hips by quite a bit. Your love handles are thick rolls that reach around from your sides to your back, folding over your hips slightly along the way.   

Deciding you want to have a look at your fupa and thighs you lift up your belly, which is no easy task. You feel the muscles in your arm strain as you struggle to lift your massive gut up, revealing your thighs and fupa. You feel the cool air on your thighs and underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, or would be a nice pillow if your belly wasn’t there to suffocate anyone who might want to use it as such. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun. 

Unable to hold up your tubby gut any longer you let gravity have its victory, causing your belly to slap into your thighs with a loud, fleshy slap that sends your whole body jiggling. Turning your gaze to the part of your tights still visible you see how they struggle for space. They’re locked in a war for space, this is mostly caused by your rather average hips and your far above average girth. Your thighs force you to waddle wherever you go, which makes walking one of your least favorite tasks, especially considering that you also have to fight your belly for every step as it pushes down on your legs. 

  Turning around to have a look at your rear the first thing that catches your eyes is your fat back. On your upper back, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up. Your back is thick with fat around your lower neck and shoulders, your shoulder blades have a roll that goes from the middle of your back and curves down towards your sides. Near the trough of the roll you see your love hands have a roll just below it. The roll from your love handles curves up from your hips and towards the center of your lower back. Just below these rolls you see your pudgy tail sticking out just above your ass. 

A little above your ass is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Speaking of cake yours is rather lacking, looking down from your back and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it.

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned and considering the fact that you&#39;re an elf, a race known for being elegant, slim and beautiful. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of royal elf lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your belly and love handles. Your lower body like your hips, thighs and ass, as well as your breasts and arms have the lowest amount of fat on them, although they&#39;re still pretty well padded.

Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge on an elvish child was a call for concern. As this behavior continued to spiral out of control and you started to turn more and more into a fat, uncivilized pig your parents took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Speaking of cake yours is rather lacking, looking down from your back and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Wolf-walker&quot;&gt;&gt;
	Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of furry royal lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your belly and love handles. Your lower body like your hips, thighs and ass, as well as your breasts and arms have the lowest amount of fat on them, although they&#39;re still pretty well padded. 
	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard. 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color1 fur that coats your face and body. The fur around your mouth has been stained with grease and has crumbs in it, left overs from your last royal binge eating session. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump snout and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Your bosom is of a decent size compared to your girth. Your breasts rest on top of your apron of a gut, they stick out about half of the distance that your fat belly does. The bra your breasts fill is covered in grease and food stains, markings of prior feasts. The cavern of your cleavage isn’t much better. Deep in its depths grease covered crumbs have been buried, the tops on your breasts tell a similar story with crumbs, spots of sauce and grease littering their soft, squishy flesh. 

Below your bosom is your massive apron of a gut, really apron is too small of a turn, it&#39;s more like a great fleshy gate that seals away your royal fupa and aristocratic thighs. Your belly is one massive roll that is surprisingly perky given its size. Your belly button is a deep damp hole located somewhere on your gut, the location is of no value to you ever since you became unable to reach the front of your globular gut. Your belly sags down to your mid thigh, hiding everything underneath, creating a sweaty fold that rarely sees the light of day unless you&#39;re pawing desperately at your needy sex. Your belly is covered in a constant shine of grease. To either side of your flabby gut is a thick love handle that juts out past your hips by quite a bit. Your love handles are thick rolls that reach around from your sides to your back, folding over your hips slightly along the way.   

Deciding you want to have a look at your fupa and thighs you lift up your belly, which is no easy task. You feel the muscles in your arm strain as you struggle to lift your massive gut up, revealing your thighs and fupa. You feel the cool air on your thighs and underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, or would be a nice pillow if your belly wasn’t there to suffocate anyone who might want to use it as such. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun. 

Unable to hold up your tubby gut any longer you let gravity have its victory, causing your belly to slap into your thighs with a loud, fleshy slap that sends your whole body jiggling. Turning your gaze to the part of your tights still visible you see how they struggle for space. They’re locked in a war for space, this is mostly caused by your rather average hips and your far above average girth. Your thighs force you to waddle wherever you go, which makes walking one of your least favorite tasks, especially considering that you also have to fight your belly for every step as it pushes down on your legs. 

  Turning around to have a look at your rear the first thing that catches your eyes is your fat back. Your back is thick with fat around your lower neck and shoulders, your shoulder blades have a roll that goes from the middle of your back and curves down towards your sides. Near the trough of the roll you see your love hands have a roll just below it. The roll from your love handles curves up from your hips and towards the center of your lower back. Just below these rolls you see your pudgy tail sticking out just above your ass. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake?

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face.

Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne, especially when that heir can turn you to ashes if she so wished. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard. 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable. 

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra.

Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Looking at your chest you see how small your breasts are relative to the rest of your corpulent form. Your small breasts are snuggly held in a bra that is too small for you, it&#39;s not that your breasts are too big for it, they fit perfectly in fact, insead it&#39;s the girth of your back rolls and side rolls that the poorly equipped bra struggles to cope with. You’ve had it expanded several times, but you’ve decided it&#39;s not worth the trouble or embarrassment, plus it&#39;s starting to get old and it&#39;s stained to quite the degree. It’s covered in grease stains, you barely wash the poor thing, in fact, besides the embarrassment, you rather like the feel of the dirty fabric. Your cleavage is small, but still deep enough to catch any crumbs that manage to escape your hungry maw.   

Below your small bosom is your, relatively, giant gut that dominates your torso. Your belly is separated into two rolls, the upper roll is the smaller of the two. Your upper belly roll holds up your small breasts and acts like a second net to catch crumbs on its greasy scales. Speaking of grease, you’re constantly covered in it; your scales are covered in a small layer of grease constantly, you prefer to wipe your pudgy hands on yourself rather than napkins. 

Your lower belly roll is considerably larger than your upper roll. It hangs down over your waist band, completely covering your fupa, and stops at about your mid-lower thigh. This makes waddling quite the task, which helps contribute to your lack of physical activity, and it does make pleasuring yourself more difficult, and exhausting. To either side of your titanic belly are a pair of thick, heavy love handles that rest on top of your wide hips. They help hold your panties in place, though with how tight they are they really don’t require any extra holding, as well as creating a very moist crevasse. 

Your hips are easily one of the largest parts of your body. They’re about two and a half feet wide, making most doorways a tight fit and servant doors impossible to pass, as well as making sitting in any chairs with arms an impossible task if they haven’t been made for your width. Your massive hips support a massive, jiggly ass and two tree trunk thighs. Your hips also make it a struggle to get your panties on or off, especially considering that they&#39;re too small already. 

Looking down at your thighs you see that they’re obstructed by your massive apron of a gut. Deciding that you are willing to put in the effort to have a look down there you lift up your belly, which is extremely difficult with your arms already burning after just a few seconds. As you lift your gut up you feel the cool air on the sweaty underside of your belly and on your thighs, and on your wet panties. 

The first thing that catches your eyes is the dark, stained, bulging triangle of purple fabric between your inner upper thighs. This fabric is what&#39;s currently visible of your poor, overworked panties. You can clearly see some staining, a lot of staining in fact. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after. 

Your thighs are thick as tree trunks, they’re mostly fat but they do have a decent amount of muscle to move your fat ass around. They’re in a constant war with each other for the limited space between your legs, forcing you to take a wider stance, which leads to you waddling, but even so your thighs still clash in a violent duel, taking up every once of space. Not to mention that the friction it creates makes waddling around even harder since you have to try to force them past each other.  Unable to hold up your gut any longer you let it drop, it impacts your thighs with a loud slap and sends reverberations around your jiggly body.   

You slowly turn around to have a look at your rear, which is quite difficult considering how fat your neck is. The first thing your eyes catch are your plentiful back rolls; you have enough rolls to easily fill a bakery. You spot your poor bra strap struggling to stay afloat in the ocean of lard that is your back. Below that you see your love handles come around to your back, forming two large rolls that meet in the center of your back. 

On your upper back, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up.

	A little above your ass, resting slightly on the doughy shelf it forms, is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. 

Just below your tail you come to the titanic shelf your ass forms; someone could easily use it as a very small desk if it was more solid and less saggy. Your panties struggle to contain your massive ass; looks like you have a large cake to go with your bakeries worth of back rolls. Your panties have a few minor tears that some of your ass fat oozes through. Your panties cling tightly to the form of your ass, following the curve perfectly, it even presses into the fat slightly, making your panties very visible in a clingy dress.

Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.            

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned and considering the fact that you&#39;re an elf, a race known for being elegant, slim and beautiful. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of royal elf lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your lower body like your hips, thighs and ass. Your belly and love handles are also pretty sizable, and your breasts and arms have the lowest amount of fat on them, although your arms are still pretty well padded. 

	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so grotesquely obese. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge on an elvish child was a call for concern. As this behavior continued to spiral out of control and you started to turn more and more into a fat, uncivilized pig your parents took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat.  Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard, especially since your parents hated you and you wanted to spite them, after all, who are they to dictate your weight? 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. You always took some pride in watching your parents squirm whenever they’d see it, you could always see the disdain in their eyes and you loved it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it anyways, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, especially your parents, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. This is something you take an odd pride in, considering that most elves have perfect, flawless skin, and here you are a disgusting slob; one of a kind. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable. 

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Looking at your chest you see how small your breasts are relative to the rest of your corpulent form. Your small breasts are snuggly held in a bra that is too small for you, it&#39;s not that your breasts are too big for it, they fit perfectly in fact, insead it&#39;s the girth of your back rolls and side rolls that the poorly equipped bra struggles to cope with. You’ve had it expanded several times, but you’ve decided it&#39;s not worth the trouble or embarrassment, plus it&#39;s starting to get old and it&#39;s stained to quite the degree. It’s covered in grease and sweat stains, you barely wash the poor thing, in fact, besides the embarrassment, you rather like the feel of the dirty fabric. Your cleavage is small, but still deep enough to catch any crumbs that manage to escape your hungry maw.   

Below your small bosom is your, relatively, giant gut that dominates your torso. Your belly is separated into two rolls, the upper roll is the smaller of the two. Your upper belly roll holds up your small breasts and acts like a second net to catch crumbs on its sweaty skin. Speaking of sweat, you’re constantly sweaty; your skin is covered in a small layer of sweat constantly and if you do any sort of physical activity, whether it be walking, standing up or even eating you start to build up quite the sweat, not to mention you quickly find yourself winded. 

Your lower belly roll is considerably larger than your upper roll. It hangs down over your waist band, completely covering your fupa, and stops at about your mid-lower thigh. This makes waddling quite the task, which helps contribute to your lack of physical activity, and it does make pleasuring yourself more difficult, and exhausting. To either side of your titanic belly are a pair of thick, heavy love handles that rest on top of your wide hips. They help hold your panties in place, though with how tight they are they really don’t require any extra holding, as well as creating a very sweaty crevasse. 

Your hips are easily one of the largest parts of your body. They’re about two and a half feet wide, making most doorways a tight fit and servant doors impossible to pass, as well as making sitting in any chairs with arms an impossible task if they haven’t been made for your width. Your massive hips support a massive, jiggly ass and two tree trunk thighs. Your hips also make it a struggle to get your panties on or off, especially considering that they&#39;re too small already. 

Looking down at your thighs you see that they’re obstructed by your massive apron of a gut. Deciding that you are willing to put in the effort to have a look down there you lift up your belly, which is extremely difficult with your arms already burning after just a few seconds. As you lift your gut up you feel the cool air on the sweaty underside of your belly and on your thighs, and on your wet panties. 

The first thing that catches your eyes is the dark, stained, bulging triangle of purple fabric between your inner upper thighs. This fabric is what&#39;s currently visible of your poor, overworked panties. You can clearly see some staining, a lot of staining in fact. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after. &lt;&lt;if $slobOp is &quot;Full&quot;&gt;&gt;You can also see a few hairs just barely sticking out of the edges of the fabric. Due to your size, and laziness, you don’t bother or care to shave down there, after all you don’t expect any visitors any time soon, or ever, despite your yearning.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your thighs are thick as tree trunks, they’re mostly fat but they do have a decent amount of muscle to move your fat ass around. They’re in a constant war with each other for the limited space between your legs, forcing you to take a wider stance, which leads to you waddling, but even so your thighs still clash in a violent duel, taking up every once of space. Not to mention that the friction it creates makes waddling around even harder since you have to try to force them past each other.  Unable to hold up your gut any longer you let it drop, it impacts your thighs with a loud slap and sends reverberations around your jiggly body.   

You slowly turn around to have a look at your rear, which is quite difficult considering how fat your neck is. The first thing your eyes catch are your plentiful back rolls; you have enough rolls to easily fill a bakery. You spot your poor bra strap struggling to stay afloat in the ocean of lard that is your back. Below that you see your love handles come around to your back, forming two large rolls that meet in the center of your back. 

   As your eyes drift downwards you eventually come to the titanic shelf your ass forms; someone could easily use it as a very small desk if it was more solid and less saggy. Your panties struggle to contain your massive ass; looks like you have a large cake to go with your bakeries worth of back rolls. Your panties have a few minor tears that some of your ass fat oozes through. Your panties cling tightly to the form of your ass, following the curve perfectly, it even presses into the fat slightly, making your panties very visible in a clingy dress.

Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.            

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Wolf-walker&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, which is something you’re not overly fond of, especially after you grew too wide for the last mirror you owned. You’ve always been a big girl, and you’ve only gotten bigger recently. Right now you’re sitting at a massive 500 pounds of furry royal lard, which will probably continue to grow. Most of that weight is concentrated in your lower body like your hips, thighs and ass. Your belly and love handles are also pretty sizable, and your breasts and arms have the lowest amount of fat on them, although your arms are still pretty well padded. 

	&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

	You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Unfortunately his efforts weren’t enough to keep the pounds off you, your gluttony and resistance as well a lack of motivation to lose the weight, truth be told you’ve become quite fond of your lard. 

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color1 fur that coats your face and body. The fur around your mouth has been stained with grease and has crumbs in it, left overs from your last royal binge eating session. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump snout and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable. 

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one.

Below your small bosom is your, relatively, giant gut that dominates your torso. Your belly is separated into two rolls, the upper roll is the smaller of the two. Your upper belly roll holds up your small breasts and acts like a second net to catch crumbs on its greasy fur. Speaking of grease, you’re constantly covered in grease; your fur is covered in a small layer of grease constantly, which is a result of your eating habits. You use your belly as a napkin to wipe your hands on, staining the fur with grease. Along with this you eat like a slob, you eat so quickly that a considerable amount ends up on you rather than in you.

Your lower belly roll is considerably larger than your upper roll. It hangs down over your waist band, completely covering your fupa, and stops at about your mid-lower thigh. This makes waddling quite the task, which helps contribute to your lack of physical activity, and it does make pleasuring yourself more difficult, and exhausting.

You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. Your face is round and heavy with pudge.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decided to take a moment to inspect yourself in the mirror. You do a quick once over yourself, your chubby body has always been a source of embarrassment for you. Your body has a top heavy build to it, with broad shoulders, chucky arms and a heavy duty pair breasts being its largest features, with its secondary features being your belly, love handles and face, and its tertiary focuses being your ass, hips and thighs.  

You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne, especially when she could burn them to ashes if she so wished. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Fairly quickly you managed to lose some weight and stagnated around 200 by sixteen, but after his retirement you found yourself slowly gaining that weight back. Now being eighteen, almost nineteen, you find yourself at rounded 250 pounds. 

Focusing back on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing your eyes focus on is your face. Your face is attractive and somewhat sharp, the main thing that sticks out to you is your $player.color1 scales. You don’t take the greatest care of them, leaving some of them dull and there are a few spots where new scales have come in, making brighter spots, but it&#39;s not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes back to your center they land on your massive breasts. Your breasts easily fill your double D bra and they are even over filling your bra quite a bit, leaving you with a deep canyon of cleavage and a chest that rips through the chests of most dresses. The soft flesh of your bosom overflows the confines of your bra, making them seem larger than they are. The tightness of your bra also creates an illusion of deeper cleavage than what you really have, plus your belly supporting your chest gives your chest an appearance similar to a corset. 

Speaking of your belly it’s fairly large, while it’s not large enough to eclipse your breasts, it is still large enough to serve as a good supporting self for your breasts. Your belly is made up from a single roll with it having a slight curve at the top, offering your breasts a soft shelf to rest on top of, before your belly curves down. Your belly has a fairly even distribution, though the bottom of your belly has a slight, if only due to gravity, extra bit of fat that sags down over your waist band.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Just above your ass is your tail, it&#39;s decently thick and is about two feet in length. It tapers down as it approaches the tip of your tail, making it similar to a rudder on a ship when you’re flying.  

Above your tail, towards your upper back, is a nice pair of wings. Your wings have a slight layer of pudge at their base, but for the most part are fairly toned and muscular, allowing you to fly fairly well even with your increased weight. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam.  
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;

You do a quick once over yourself, your chubby body has always been a source of embarrassment for you, especially considering you&#39;re an elf.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Fairly quickly you managed to lose some weight and stagnated around 200 by sixteen, but after his retirement you found yourself slowly gaining that weight back. Now being eighteen, almost nineteen, you find yourself at rounded 250 pounds. 

Focusing back on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes back to your center they land on your massive breasts. Your breasts easily fill your double D bra and they are even over filling your bra quite a bit, leaving you with a deep canyon of cleavage and a chest that rips through the chests of most dresses. The soft flesh of your bosom overflows the confines of your bra, making them seem larger than they are. The tightness of your bra also creates an illusion of deeper cleavage than what you really have, plus your belly supporting your chest gives your chest an appearance similar to a corset. 

Speaking of your belly it’s fairly large, while it’s not large enough to eclipse your breasts, it is still large enough to serve as a good supporting self for your breasts. Your belly is made up from a single roll with it having a slight curve at the top, offering your breasts a soft shelf to rest on top of, before your belly curves down. Your belly has a fairly even distribution, though the bottom of your belly has a slight, if only due to gravity, extra bit of fat that sags down over your waist band.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam. 
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Wolf-walker&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decided to take a moment to inspect yourself in the mirror. You do a quick once over yourself, your chubby body has always been a source of embarrassment for you. Your body has a top heavy build to it, with broad shoulders, chucky arms and a heavy duty pair breasts being its largest features, with its secondary features being your belly, love handles and face, and its tertiary focuses being your ass, hips and thighs.

While your chest may be rather lacking you’ve found that your breasts are still quite eye-catching, as well as making your other assets look larger and more pronounced, and they’re very sensitive, which you often use in the heat of passion.

Your belly is a massive apron of fat that distends out in front of you and hangs down onto your thighs. It’s one large continuous roll of fat that dangles off of your body and shoots out in front of you. Right in the middle of your belly lower down is your cavern of a belly button.

Above your tail, towards your upper back, is a nice pair of wings. Your wings have a slight layer of pudge at their base, but for the most part are fairly toned and muscular, allowing you to fly fairly well even with your increased weight.

They couldn’t just bar you from eating what you wanted to eat, they were sparsely around to stop you and not many servants are willing to argue with the sole heir to the throne. They decided to levi the kingdom&#39;s marshall, Strengmann, to deal with your eating habits and weight gain.

Strengmann was harsh in his efforts, but not uncaring. He spent time with you after you exercised, introduced you to other people your age and helped you find hobbies to do rather than eat. Fairly quickly you managed to lose some weight and stagnated around 200 by sixteen, but after his retirement you found yourself slowly gaining that weight back. Now being eighteen, almost nineteen, you find yourself at rounded 250 pounds. 

Focusing back on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes to your center your eyes land on your small breasts. Your breasts barely manage to fill your small B bra, leaving you with no cleavage and a chest that barely fills a dress. While your chest may be rather lacking you’ve found that your breasts are still quite eye-catching, as well as making your other assets look larger and more pronounced, and they’re very sensitive, which you often use in the heat of passion.

Your belly is a massive apron of fat that distends out in front of you and hangs down onto your thighs. It’s one large continuous roll of fat that dangles off of your body and shoots out in front of you. Right in the middle of your belly lower down is your cavern of a belly button. It’s a deep dark, warm hole, that you’ve found to be surprisingly sensitive in moments of passion. You’re belly is joined on either side by a pair of thick love handles that stretch out most dresses you wear.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Before getting dressed you decided to take a moment to inspect yourself in the mirror. You do a quick once over yourself, your chubby body has always been a source of embarrassment for you. Your body has a bottom heavy build to it, with wide hips, robust thighs and a heavy duty ass being its largest features, with its secondary features being your belly and love handles, and its tertiary focuses being your breasts, arms and face.  

You take a moment to reflect upon yourself and what has led to you being so portly. Ever since you were a young girl you alway had a taste for anything sweet or savory, which in turn led to eating more meat and pies at feasts or snacking on more decadent delights in your free time. Your mother and father grew concerned by this behavior, a little pudge was nothing to worry about but as you grew older and the pounds kept coming they took action.

Now being eighteen, almost nineteen, you find yourself at rounded 250 pounds. 

Focusing back on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing your eyes focus on is your face. Your face is attractive and somewhat sharp, the main thing that sticks out to you is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; scales. You don’t take the greatest care of them, leaving some of them dull and there are a few spots where new scales have come in, making brighter spots, but it&#39;s not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards over your neck they come to your shoulders. Your shoulders are coated in a thin layer of fat that hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you have much muscle to hide any way. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a small layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles.

Below you’re small bosom rest your large double belly. Your belly comfortably hands over the waistband of your panties and almost reaches down to touch your thighs, for the time being it simply obscures your chucky fupa. The upper roll of your belly would make for an excellent shelf for your breasts, if only your breasts were actually big enough to require, or even reach, your upper belly. Separating the two rolls of your belly is a sallow canyon with a deep hole that is your belly button right in the center. Wrapping around from your lower belly roll is a pair of thick love handles that rest lazily on top of your child bearing hips.  

Your hips are very wide, wider than your shoulders by quite a bit and well padded too. Most of your fat resides in your lower body, namely your hips, thighs and ass. Letting your eyes run over the curve you notice how the soft flesh divots from the waistband of your panties digging into them, the depth of these divots seems to constantly increase as the girth your panties are tasked with containing ever increases. 

Moving your gaze further down the outline of your hips your eyes soon come to your hips widest point before they taper down leading to your thighs. You let your gaze wander down the edge of your thigh before you move your gaze across the width of your thigh. You take note of the girth of your thighs and the soft, perfect flesh of your thighs. Your two thunder thighs smash together, you can’t remember ever having a thigh gap. Your two soft thighs seem to be fighting a savage war with each other for space as their ever expanding size demands more space. This has led to you having a very slight waddle as your thighs rub against one another.  

Deciding that you’ve inspected your thighs enough you decided to move on to your last, and best, asset; your chunky ass. Turning around and twisting your neck you’re just able to see your full moon. Your poor panties struggle to contain your ass, the poor fabric just manages to keep a tenuous grip on a triangle shaped area of ass. The fat is compressed in this area, highlighting your recent gains and giving the rest of your ass a larger appearance. Towards the lower part of your ass cheeks you see some cellulite that has started to form. Your posterior easily sticks out several inches from your back, if you so wished you could use it as a small shelf, though a jiggly wobbly shelf really wouldn’t be of much use.

Finished with looking at your corpulent body you decide it time to get dressed for the day, of course you don’t dress yourself, considering your size and that your royalty. You waddle back from the mirror, taking one last look at yourself. “Gabriela!” you shout towards the door, hoping that your voluptuous helper is near enough the door to hear you, you’d hate to have to waddle around looking for her.

After a moment the door opens and in steps Gabriela, her wide hips swaying as she walks towards you. Her dress is tight against her full, womanly frame. Her bosom is full, her thighs thick from what you can tell, her hips child bearing and a tubby little gut to match.

Her gaze meets yours and in an instant sees what you&#39;re looking at. A smile graced her lips, a flash of satisfaction in her eyes, but also a flash of something else you can’t quite identify. She stops half way between you and the door, puts her hand on her hip and looks you up and down. You feel her hard, brown eyes on you, taking in every nook and cranny. Her eyes seem to shine with approval as she spots things, those things you&#39;re unsure of, but you love the attention from her, it&#39;s something you rarely get.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.bodyS&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Strawberry&quot;&gt;&gt;
“I see the royal pig has been indulging in some late night feasting while mother and father are away. What would the retired marshall think if he saw you now? Let&#39;s get you cleaned up before putting a dress on you; dresses are made for people, not pigs, after all. Though with those udders you are more akin to a cow than a pig.” She pauses and looks at you, your cheeks have flustered and you&#39;re standing there looking at her like a peasant before the gallows. She smiles another one of those little smiles and her eyes light up with satisfaction before they harden with mild annoyance. “Come on, you know the drill. Bra, panties, off now. I’ll go get a bucket and rag to clean you.”

With that she turns and leaves the room, you hear a guard outside say something to her, followed by her reply, which is replied with in turn by laughter. Deciding to do as she asks you to go about trying to remove your bra. The only issue is that you physically can’t reach the straps, something Gabriela is well aware of. Nevertheless you are struggling your best, desperately trying to get your fat fingers to reach. You’re so focused on your task that you don’t even hear Gabriela enter the room.

“Jesus, are you really so fat you can’t even take off your bra? Get over here and let me help you.” You feel your face turn a shade of dark red. Reluctantly you waddle over to her as she sets down the bucket of steaming water. “What a good cow! You might be utterly useless, but you follow directions so well!” She seems to say this extra loud, as if to purposely make sure the guards outside the door can hear every word. You hear a few snickers from the other side of the door, but your focus is quickly interrupted when Gabriela grabs you and spins you around. 

“Oh lord! How does someone get this many damned back rolls? I can barely see the strap buried in there!” You feel her hands on your back, poking and poking the rolls around your bra strap as if she’s looking for it. “How are you possibly so sweaty? It’s a little chilly in here, not to mention you haven’t done anything other than get out of bed!” She spends a few more moments touching your rolls before finally undoing your bra strap.

Your breasts in an instant are taken by gravity and flop down to your stomach. They slam into your gut with a meaty slap, sending a wave of pleasure through you as well as a wave of embarrassment. Your bra sinks to the floor, coming to a rest at your feed; stained and wet. You feel the cool air on your nipples and they grow hard, this is aided by your increasing arousal at the humiliating spectacle you find yourself in. 

“My god, if I didn’t know any better I’d say those things have enough milk in them to feed a whole ward! Too bad they’re just filled with useless lard! Now, let&#39;s get these panties off you, I’d prefer to spend as little time touching your revolting form as possible!” Her hands make their way down to your hips, stopping briefly at your love handles to take a little squeeze. “Oh, great, your waistband is buried under more lard!” She runs her hands on your hips and back up to your love handles. She lifts it up before setting it back down, causing your belly to jiggle. She repeats this once more, this time grabbing the waistband that rests at the bottom of the canyon your hips and love handles form. You feel her slip her fingers into the waistband, keeping on hand near where she started while the other slides around to your other hip, pulling the waistband out of your sea of lard as it went.

“Never has undressing someone been such a difficult task, wrought with challenges all caused by an inability to stop stuffing oneself!” She proclaims as she lowers your panties. You feel the cool air touch gently on your nethers as the panties are removed before your lard quickly fills the space. One the panties are down to about your shines you hear Gabriela let out a chuckle. 

“My, my, has the royal piggy been having some fun recently? These poor panties are drenched in sweet fiery pleasure! Though I’m sure you were the only one giving and receiving that pleasure!” Your cheeks burn brightly at the statement, and even more brightly from the laughing coming from outside the door. More than anything you feel shame at the fact that she is partially right, and shame from the fact that the wetness is just caused by your natural state of being, spurred on by this morning&#39;s encounter.  

She lets the panties drop the rest of the way to the floor, she then moves, bringing the bucket and rag closer to you before moving around to your front. She looks you up and down before shaking her head. “For someone so fat you’d think you’d be pretty good at keeping the food in your mouth!” She then crouches down, wetting the rag and wringing it out before standing back up.

She brings the warm, wet rag to your face and starts to clean it off, leaving no traces of grease or crumbs. Next she does the same to your neck and armpits before moving onto your chest. She starts out high, wiping down the area near your neck before moving down. She makes her way to your cleavage, her hands grabbing and moving the breasts fat out of the way as she cleans. Satisfied with her work she moves onto your breasts properly. She grabs one of your massive breasts and starts to clean it. You feel the rag and her fingers graze your hard nipple as she cleans around it. FInally she starts to clean the nipple itself, she makes small gentle strokes on it. You bite your lip as the pleasure builds until she finally lets your breast go and repeats the process on the other one. 

As she cleans the nipple again you can’t help but let out a stifled moan, not even looking up from her work Gabriela again begins to speak. “Aw, did the touch deprived cow like that? Does she like it when her nipples are cleaned of all the filth she’s accumulated?” Overwhelmed you simply nod, wishing for more pleasure, as wrong as it seems. “Good.” Her reply was simple and impactful. 

She finished up with your breasts and moved onto your stomach. She made sure to be extra rough with it, causing it to jiggle and bounce with every motion as she cleaned it. She next started on your love handles, making sure to clean the fold between them and your hips. After that she moves onto your lackluster hips, just giving them a quick wipe down. 

She puts the rag in the water and sits back on her haunches and looks at your lower belly before looking up at you. “Pick up your gut and spread your legs so I can clean your dirty, piggy cunt.” You obeyed, this wasn&#39;t the first time this had happened, but it had been a while. You knew to expect her to wash down there, taking great care to tease you before moving on. 

She picked up the rag and wrung it out before leaning forwards and begging to wash your hairy fupa. The warm rag felt good, and the feeling of her fingers scrubbing against your sensitive roll was even better. She then moved on to your cum covered thighs, washing away your arousal and shame. Finally she started to wash your pussy lips, however rather than just cleaning them she also ventured a little deeper. You felt the soft fibers of the rag move into your slit, brushing against your clit, sending waves of pleasure though you. The cleaning lasted all of a few seconds, but that was all you needed. 

Your knees quivered as you came, a moan of surprise and delight escaped your lips. A moment of mortified silence fell over the room before Gabriela let out a chuckle. “Wow, I knew you were pathetic, but that was something else.” She tossed the rag into the bucket before standing up. “Now, let&#39;s get you dressed.” She said before walking over to the nearby dresser to retrieve a clean pair of panties and a bra. 

“A-aren’t you going to clean that up?” You tentatively asked, referring to the wetness now soaking into your inner thigh.

“No, of course not.” She said as she grabbed a bra, pair of panties and a dress before walking over and setting them on the bed. “I want you to spend the rest of the day feeling your wet mess, thinking about how pathetic you are.”

You stand there in shock, and arousal, at her words. She grabs the bra and makes her way over to you. She stands behind you and wraps the bra around you before making sure your breasts are neatly cupped in the clean bra. She then starts to do the bra up. You hear her grunt slightly as she struggles to bring the two halves close enough together, but after a small struggle she manages and once more your breasts are contained. 

Certain that the bra will hold, at least for now, she walks over and grabs a pair of panties. “Take a step back.” Contently you do as she commands. She throws the old panties aside and places the new ones on the floor. “Step forward.” Again you contently obeyed her orders, stepping into the leg holes of the panties. “Good girl.” She grabs the waistband of the panties and begins to lift them up. As she reaches your hips she has to work a little bit harder to get them to fit, but they easily slide into the slit between your hips and love handles.       

“Now to get that dress on you.” She walks over and grabs the dress, it looks more like a bed sheet than a stylish dress. She starts to wind it up in her hands, making sure the head hole is facing towards herself. “Arms up.” You struggle to get your arms up which elicits a raised  eyebrow from Gabriela. She raises the dress over you, making sure to line up your head and arm holes before bringing it down over you. It&#39;s a snug fit but it goes over your arms and head. She then starts the process of pulling it down over your breasts and belly before letting gravity to the rest of the work.

“Well, looks like you still fit in the dress. What a shame.” She says as she makes her way to the door before opening it. She starts to walk out before stopping half way in the door frame, she turns to look back at you. “Until next time, my fat sow.” Before she closes the door and walks away; job completed. 

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Apple&quot;&gt;&gt;
“I see the royal pig has been indulging in some late night feasting while mother and father are away. What would the retired marshall think if he saw you now? Let&#39;s get you cleaned up before putting a dress on you; dresses are made for people, not pigs, after all. Though with the size of that gut I do have to wonder if any dress would even fit on you and not look ridiculous.” She pauses and looks at you, your cheeks have flustered and you&#39;re standing there looking at her like a peasant before the gallows. She smiles another one of those little smiles and her eyes light up with satisfaction before they harden with mild annoyance. “Come on, you know the drill. Bra, panties, off now. I’ll go get a bucket and rag to clean you.”

With that she turns and leaves the room, you hear a guard outside say something to her, followed by her reply, which is replied with in turn by laughter. Deciding to do as she asks you to go about trying to remove your bra. The only issue is that you physically can’t reach the straps, something Gabriela is well aware of. Nevertheless you are struggling your best, desperately trying to get your fat fingers to reach. You’re so focused on your task that you don’t even hear Gabriela enter the room.

“Jesus, are you really so fat you can’t even take off your bra? Get over here and let me help you.” You feel your face turn a shade of dark red. Reluctantly you waddle over to her as she sets down the bucket of steaming water. “What a good piggy! You might be utterly useless, but you follow directions so well!” She seems to say this extra loud, as if to purposely make sure the guards outside the door can hear every word. You hear a few snickers from the other side of the door, but your focus is quickly interrupted when Gabriela grabs you and spins you around. 

“Oh lord! How does someone get this many damned back rolls? I can barely see the strap buried in there!” You feel her hands on your back, poking and poking the rolls around your bra strap as if she’s looking for it. “How are you possibly so sweaty? It’s a little chilly in here, not to mention you haven’t done anything other than get out of bed!” She spends a few more moments touching your rolls before finally undoing your bra strap.

Your bra falls away, your breasts are quickly taken by the forces of gravity and, with a meaty slap, collide with your massive gut. You feel your belly and love handles wobble slightly from the impact. Gabriela walks around to your front, bends down and wets the rag. She reaches out her hand and gives your belly a light slap. She watches as your rolls wobble and jiggle from the action, a satisfied smile graces her lips. “You must be almost pure lard for a little tap like that to cause such movement! I do wonder what a harder, much harder, slap would do?”

Sensing that her question isn’t one to be answered, you decide it&#39;s best to remain silent. Gabriela seems to sense your submission, her smile of satisfaction intensifies as she grabs your fat face and starts to wipe it clean. “What would you do without me, piggy princess? Who would you have to wipe your fat face clean? Who would you have to take such loving care of you? You can thank me later piggy, or better yet, thank me now. Go ahead, thank me. Now.

You suddenly find yourself a tad flustered and stammer slightly. Her grip on your face tightens, you feel her pull you closer. “What&#39;s wrong piggy? Don’t you want to thank your oh so wonderful caretaker? And here I thought you enjoyed our time together? Oh, don’t give me that look, I know you enjoy my touch. Don’t you think I notice the hardening of your nipples, the way you squeeze your thighs together, and especially the fresh wetness between your legs. Now, be a good girl and say thank you.”

“I-I, uh, t-thank you.” You feel humiliated being forced to thank someone so far below you, yet a part of you seems to like it ever so slightly. Gabriela smiles; she smiles the smile of a hunter whose prey has just fallen for a trap. 

“I don’t think that will do. Be more specific when you thank me, thank me for cleaning your fat dirty rolls. Thank me for dressing your fat ass. Thank me for touching you and talking to you in such an intimate way.” Her grip tightens, pulling you closer and squishing your lips into a slight pucker.

“I-I-I, thank y-you. T-thank you for…” Your hesitation elisets the grip tightening. “Thank you for cleaning my fat dirty rolls. Thank you for dressing my f-fat ass. Thank you for touching me and talking to me like the piggy I am!” A wave of embarrassment washes over you as you realize your dual error of partially yelling that and calling yourself a pig. Gabriela’s face lights up, seeing that you’ve given into her, well, in this moment you’ve given into her. “Er, I-I-I m-mean, thank you for being so-”

Before you can try to back out of what you just said Gabriela interrupts you. “Aw, you’re welcome piggy. Now let&#39;s get back to cleaning you up.” With that she resumes wiping off your face before moving onto your neck and upper chest. She then moves onto your cleavage, taking her time to make sure every inch of corpulent flesh is clean.

Once she seems satisfied with the state of your cleavage she moves onto your breasts proper. She takes careful care of your breasts, taking extra time to make sure to clean out any sweat or grease that might have found its way to your underboob. Finally she makes her way to cleaning off the area around your nipples, though there isn’t really anything to clean there it feels pretty good, so no point in complaining. 

Once finished cleaning off your breasts, and causing you to be just a bit wetter, she moves onto cleaning off your globular gut. Your gut is a massive expanse of fat that dominates your frame, and is a massive grease and crumb catcher. Gabriela glides the wet rag up and down your gut, making sure to clean up every crumb and drop of grease. She gets between every fold and roll, taking special care for the roll your love handles and hips form.After that she moves onto your lackluster hips, just giving them a quick wipe down. 

She puts the rag in the water and sits back on her haunches and looks at your lower belly before looking up at you. “Pick up your gut and spread your legs so I can clean your dirty, piggy cunt.” You obeyed, this wasn&#39;t the first time this had happened, but it had been a while. You knew to expect her to wash down there, taking great care to tease you before moving on. 

She picked up the rag and wrung it out before leaning forwards and begging to wash your hairy fupa. The warm rag felt good, and the feeling of her fingers scrubbing against your sensitive roll was even better. She then moved on to your cum covered thighs, washing away your arousal and shame. Finally she started to wash your pussy lips, gently wiping away all the sweat and cum that&#39;s there, momentarily removing the seemingly omnipresent shine of your arousal. Every little wipe edges you on, bringing you closer to climax; but Gabriela is far too skilled as a teaser to ever let you cum without intending for you to cum. 

Suddenly the teasing ends as Gabriela removes the wet rag from your soaking loins, placing it back into the bucket. “Alright, looks like we’re all done here piggy, now you&#39;re all nice and clea-What do we have here?” You feel Gabriela’s hands on your midsection, her hands moving towards your belly button. “Looks like we missed a spot; your belly button is disgusting! Let&#39;s get it cleaned up.”

Gabriela picks up the rag and wrings it out before bringing it up to the rim of your belly button. She cleans in circles around your deep, sweaty hole; you feel a familiar pleasure building. Slowly she advances the rag deeper into your dirty hole. You feel your nethers heating up and the rag moves inwards; the pleasure building with every nudge and movement as it tries to clean up every ounce of grime. You feel yourself on the cusp of an orgasm as the riggling rag cleans out your dirty hole. 

Suddenly the dam bursts, your knees quiver and you let out a moan of pleasure before you can stop yourself. A moment of mortified silence fell over the room before Gabriela let out a chuckle. “Wow, I knew you were pathetic, but that was something else. I’ve never seen a pig cum from having her belly button cleaned” She tossed the rag into the bucket before standing up. “Now, let&#39;s get you dressed.” She said before walking over to the nearby dresser to retrieve a clean pair of panties and a bra.     

“A-aren’t you going to clean that up?” You tentatively asked, referring to the wetness now soaking into your inner thigh.

“No, of course not.” She said as she grabbed a bra, pair of panties and a dress before walking over and setting them on the bed. “I want you to spend the rest of the day feeling your wet mess, thinking about how pathetic you are.”

You stand there in shock, and arousal, at her words. She grabs the bra and makes her way over to you. She stands behind you and wraps the bra around you before making sure your breasts are neatly cupped in the clean bra. She then starts to do the bra up. You hear her grunt slightly as she struggles to bring the two halves close enough together, but after a small struggle she manages and once more your breasts are contained.

She raises the dress over you, making sure to line up your head and arm holes before bringing it down over you. It&#39;s a snug fit but it goes over your arms and head. She then starts the process of pulling it down over your breasts. 

Once over your breasts though Gabriela faces the challenge of getting the dress over your fat gut, which is easier said than done. She tugs the fabric down, making sure it falls into place properly. After a bit of pushing and pulling she is able to get it over the largest part of your gut and gravity does the rest, leaving you fully dressed. 

“Well, looks like you still fit in the dress. What a shame.” She says as she makes her way to the door before opening it. She starts to walk out before stopping half way in the door frame, she turns to look back at you. “Until next time, my fat sow.” Before she closes the door and walks away; job completed.

“I see the royal pig has been indulging in some late night feasting while mother and father are away. What would the retired marshall think if he saw you now?

You might be utterly useless, but you follow directions so well!” She seems to say this extra loud, as if to purposely make sure the guards outside the door can hear every word.

I can barely see the strap buried in there!” You feel her hands on your back, poking and poking the rolls around your bra strap as if she’s looking for it. “How are you possibly so sweaty? It’s a little chilly in here, not to mention you haven’t done anything other than get out of bed!” She spends a few more moments touching your rolls before finally undoing your bra strap.

Your bra falls away, tumbling down your double belly and down to the floor, leaving your small breasts exposed. Your small breasts drop slightly but for the most part remain pretty perky, resting on your upper belly for support. You feel your nipples harden slightly in the cool air, but also due to the spicy situation you find yourself in. 

“Look at those little tiny breasts of yours! Well, tiny compared to the rest of you that is, you fat, fucking whale.” She says as she slowly walks around to the front of you, surveying your body as she goes, a satisfied look on her face. “Now, let&#39;s see if we can get those panties off of you without them ripping.” She moves around to the front of you and lowers herself down a bit. “It seems your flabby love handles are obscuring your waistband. Great, I get to go poking around more of your sweaty folds.”  

You feel her hands on the warm, sweaty flesh of your love handles as she lifts up the flab in order to grab the waistband of your panties. Her fingers navigate their way down under your love handle roll, making their way to your waistband. You feel her finger reach the sweaty fabric of your skin tight waistband. Her fingers dig at the waistband, trying to remove it from its dug in position. “How the hell did you get these on? I can’t even get a good grip on these because of how deep they&#39;re buried in your lard! Here, hold up your love handle so I can use both hands.”

Your face turns red at the fact that she can’t even grab your waistband because of how fat you are. You grab your love handle, holding it up so she can use both hands to dig out your waistband. You feel her fingers dig at your soft flesh as she struggles to get a grip on it. After a minute or two you feel her fingers finally side under the waistband. You feel her slide the fingers on her other hand under the waistband before sliding them backwards towards your rear while keeping her other hand in place. Gabriela moves around to your rear, her hand sliding under your waistband around, past your ass, and to your other hip. Due to your width and girth this forces her to spread her arms and pressing her firmly into your ass. 

“God you’re fat, I can barely reach your fat sides, not to mention the fact your massive ass forces me so far away from you. I can feel your sweat soaking into my dress. I’ll probably have to throw the poor thing out from the staining it’ll get.” You feel her hands tense around the waistband, firmly gripping it. “I think that maybe you owe me a new dress.” Her hands start to pull the panties up, pressing the tight fabric into your wet sex. “Or maybe, payment can be given in another manner.” She pulls up harder as well as pushing and pulling the fabric causing it to tightly rub your fat nethers, moving you towards ecstacy. 

She pulls tighter, the movements becoming more and more violent. The pleasure grows more and more potent, drowning out other thoughts with the growing white fire of a climax. You feel yourself about to orgasm when suddenly the pressure on your pussy stops, punctuated with a loud rip. It takes your numbed mind a moment to realize what happened; your panties ripped.

You hear Gabriela chuckle. “You seem confused piggy, did you think that an orgasm was going to be your payment? Of course not! Making you rip your panties was the payment, an eye for an eye if you will. Now, let&#39;s get these tattered rags off you and clean you up.” With one good jerk she pulls what&#39;s left of your panties down your legs, leaving them on the floor below you. “Aw, they’re soaking wet! Was piggy enjoying that? I bet by those little moans she was making that she was!” 

Your face turns bright red, you feel yourself further wetten down south, as Gabriela walks around in front of you, bends down grabbing the rag and wrings it out. She then approaches your front and starts to clean off your face. She takes special care to make sure that she gets every crumb and drop of grease off your face; from your lips to your double chin and down to your neck. She makes her way to your cleavage, her hands grabbing and moving the breasts fat out of the way as she cleans. Satisfied with her work she moves onto your breasts properly. She grabs one of your small breasts and starts to clean it. She gives the small tit a simple wipe down before letting it go and doing the same to the other one. 

Taking a small step back Gabriela surveys her work so far. Seeming satisfied she crouches, dipping the rag in the water before wringing it out. Standing back up she starts to wash your double belly. She starts with your upper belly, taking her time to wipe it down, getting every crumb off your flabby gut. “You know I had no idea someone could get so fat that their belly could separate into two rolls. Though I had no idea someone could even get as big as you, not to mention; I had no clue someone&#39;s ass could get to such a massive size. I mean it&#39;s the size of the throne! I wouldn’t be surprised if you had to have it widened.” 

Her words made you blush slightly as she moved onto your lower belly. You felt her start to clean the slight fold between your two bellies before moving onto your lower belly proper. You feel her make her way to your belly button, the warm rag doing circles around it. You felt a bit of pleasure being touched this way, making your dripping cunt yearn for more than just a washing. Feeling the rag enter your belly button you let out a little moan of pleasure as she cleans it out. 

“It’s so cute how you like that. You’re like a fat sow in heat. It&#39;s so easy to elicit a moan or whimper of pleasure.” You feel the rag exit your belly button. Gabriela dips it back in the water and wrings it out before washing your love handles and belly overhang. “God, no wonder you&#39;re so damn horny. With a belly like this I bet you haven’t been able to pleasure yourself in quite some time.” Finally you feel her finish washing your belly, she dips the rag in the water once more before wringing it out.

“Lift up your belly and spread your legs so I can wash your dirty little cunt of yours.” Doing as you&#39;re told you take on a wider stance before lifting up your belly, which is something that is rather difficult considering its weight and your lack of strength. “God you’re a fat pig, even with your legs spread like that your inner thighs still touch.” You feel the warm rag start to scrub your inner thighs, slowly making its way up to your fat pussy. As she moves the rag up she has to use her other hand to help move your fat out of the way, all the extra touching only increases your arousal. “Good lord, it&#39;s so wet down here. I’m not sure how much of this is sweat or cum.”

You feel the rag finally make contact with your pussy lips, her fingers work it around the edge of your lips, cleaning and teasing you. You already feel like you&#39;re about to cum and you&#39;re desperate for her to just go a little further. You feel her move the rag a little more towards your inner pussy lips. You feel yourself starting to climax as the rag cleans the area around your clit. 

Your thighs squeeze around Gabriela arms, your knees quiver and you let out a moan of pleasure as you cum. Once your orgasm passes you feel her pull her arm out and you hear you chuckling. Your face turns red as you realize what just happened. “Aw, does this piggy like having her pussy touched? She came so easily, good girl. Now, let&#39;s get your fat ass packed into a nice dress.” She says tossing the rag into the bucket of water and standing up before walking over to the nearby dresser. 

“A-aren’t you going to clean that up?” You tentatively asked, referring to the wetness now soaking into your inner thigh.

“No, of course not.” She said as she grabbed a bra, pair of panties and a dress before walking over and setting them on the bed. “I want you to spend the rest of the day feeling your wet mess, thinking about how pathetic you are.”

You stand there in shock, and arousal, at her words. She grabs the bra and makes her way over to you. She stands behind you and wraps the bra around you before making sure your breasts are neatly cupped in the clean bra. She then starts to do the bra up.

After a bit of pushing and pulling she is able to get it over the largest part of your gut and gravity does the rest, well that is until the dress catches on your ass shelf. She makes her way around to your rear and starts to tug the fabric down over your ass. It takes a bit of effort but she finally manages to get the dress over it, leaving you fully dressed. 

“Well, looks like you still fit in the dress. What a shame.” She says as she makes her way to the door before opening it. She starts to walk out before stopping half way in the door frame, she turns to look back at you. “Until next time, my fat sow.” Before she closes the door and walks away; job completed. 
&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;
  
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;

	Finished with looking at your chubby body you decide it time to get dressed for the day, of course you don’t dress yourself, considering that your royalty. You walk back from the mirror, taking one last look at yourself. “Gabriela!” you shout towards the door, hoping that your voluptuous helper is near enough the door to hear you, you’d hate to have to walk around, working up a sweat, looking for her.

After a moment the door opens and in steps Gabriela, her wide hips swaying as she walks towards you. Her dress is tight against her full, womanly frame. Her bosom is full, her thighs thick from what you can tell, her hips child bearing and a tubby little gut to match.

Her gaze meets yours and in an instant sees what you&#39;re looking at. A slight smile graced her lips, a flash of mild satisfaction in her eyes, but also a flash of something else you can’t quite identify. She stops half way between you and the door, puts her hand on her hip and looks you up and down. You feel her hard, brown eyes on you, taking in every nook and cranny. Her eyes seem to shine with approval as she spots things, however you also see mild dissatisfaction at other things, those things you&#39;re unsure of, but you like the attention from her, it&#39;s something you don’t get often.

“Gabriela, my eyes are up here. Now please get my dress and dress me, mother and father are bound to be here soon.” You say, breaking Gabriela’s eyes away from your body and up towards you eyes. She locks eyes with you, you see a hint of resentment being ordered, but you see it quickly fade, instead replaced by a neutral gaze.

“Of course your highness. I’ll grab your red dress at once.” Gabriela says, almost in a sly tone as she crosses the room and moves to the dresser. You feel a moment of rage, you know she knows that dress doesn’t fit anymore. It hasn’t for months now.

“No, not the red dress, I would like the purple dress.” Gabriela stops pulling out the red dress, she turns and looks at you. Her face is full of famed confusion.

“But your highness, you look so much finer in the red dress. I know how much your mother and father would love to see you in it. After all, it was a gift from Barron Reganold.” Again Gabriela’s counter leaves no room for an easy counter. Mother and father always did have a special affection for Barron Reganold, however, there is simply no way my body will fit in that dress. “You’ve never been this way before, you used to love this dress. Has something happened?”

Caught between a rock and a hard place you admit defeat rather than argue with her any longer. “It doesn’t fit.” You say quickly, averting your gaze from her.

“I beg your pardon?”

“I said it doesn’t fit. Now the purple dress please.” Gabriela has always seemed to have an ability to get under one&#39;s skin and hit them where it hurts all while seeming perfectly innocent before revealing her true self once her prey is on its back foot.
  
“Oh I know it doesn’t fit, just wanted to hear the bloated princesses say it. Oh, do give me that look porky. You know you like it, that&#39;s why you haven’t fired me yet.” You felt your face blush red, both with anger, embarrassment and oddly enough, arousal?

“I-i-just get the purple dress.”

“Oh, with pleasure.” Gabriela puts the red dress back in the dresser before pulling out a larger purple dress. She looks at it for a moment, examining it before looking up at you. “Pretty soon this one won’t fit either. Just like the last one and the one before that.” She teases as she walks over to you.

“You’re not exactly slim yourself Gabriela.” You fire back, hoping to strike a nerve.
&lt;&lt;switch $player.bodyS&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Strawberry&quot;&gt;&gt;
“And I love the extra pudge. Give me a bit more weight to-well, you’ll find out one day. Now, arms up, gut in.” Her last statement was a gut punch, literally. You raised your arms up allowing the dress to slide over your head. Once over your head and arms Gabriela went about making sure the dress went over your large bosom smoothly before letting gravity do the rest. Leaving you fully dressed. 
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Apple&quot;&gt;&gt;
“And I love the extra pudge. Give me a bit more weight to-well, you’ll find out one day. Now, arms up, gut in.” Her last statement was a gut punch, literally.

	“And I love the extra pudge. Give me a bit more weight to-well, you’ll find out one day. Now, arms up, gut in.” Her last statement was a gut punch, literally. You raised your arms up allowing the dress to slide over your head. Once over your head, arms and torso Gabriela went about making sure the dress went over your large ass smoothly before letting gravity do the rest. Leaving you fully dressed. 
	&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;
“You’re free to go now Gabriela.” You tell her, not particularly wanting her to stick around too much longer. 

 “Well, looks like you still fit in the dress. What a shame, though I have a feeling it’ll burst off soon” She says as she makes her way to the door before opening it. She starts to walk out before stopping half way in the door frame, she turns to look back at you. “Until next time, my growing porker.” Before she closes the door and walks away; job completed. 
&lt;&lt;case 3 4&gt;&gt; 

	Finished with looking at your body you decide it time to get dressed for the day, of course you don’t dress yourself, considering that your royalty. You walk back from the mirror, taking one last look at yourself. “Gabriela!” you shout towards the door, hoping that your voluptuous helper is near enough the door to hear you, you’d hate to have to walk around looking for her.

After a moment the door opens and in steps Gabriela, her wide hips swaying as she walks towards you. Her dress is tight against her full, womanly frame. Her bosom is full, her thighs thick from what you can tell, her hips child bearing and a tubby little gut to match.

Her gaze meets yours and in an instant sees what you&#39;re looking at. A slight smile graced her lips, a flash of mild satisfaction in her eyes, but also a flash of something else you can’t quite identify. She stops half way between you and the door, puts her hand on her hip and looks you up and down. You feel her hard, brown eyes on you, taking in every nook and cranny. Her eyes seem to have a look of dissatisfaction to them as they gaze over your body. You wonder what she could possibly be thinking about for her to have such a look. 

“Gabriela, when you’re done giving me a good look over will you please dress me?” Your speaking brings her gaze back up to your eyes. You see her gaze is rather bored, whatever emotion was there she has hidden or has vanished.

Gabriela crosses the room, reaching your dresser rather quickly. She opens it and takes out a nice purple dress before walking back over to you. Silently you raise your arms up so she can slide the dress over you.

“You’re so skinny my lady. It would do you, and your public perception some good to gain some weight.” She says as she slides the dress over you and starts to make sure it falls into place as it should.

“Maybe, maybe. I have a feeling mother and father wouldn’t like that, but, a little opportunity for some indulgence doesn&#39;t sound too bad. I guess we’ll see what the future holds.” You respond back to her. You don’t dislike the idea, in fact you kind of like it. Having a little extra girth might help to make you seem more friendly to the public or maybe it might even be seen as a sign of prosperity? Not to mention you just like the idea of having a little chub, but just a little. 

Gabriela finishes up the last few adjustments on your dress, leaving you fully dressed and ready to start your day. “Well, I think putting on a few pounds might make it a little easier to catch a lords eyes” She says as she makes her way to the door before opening it. She starts to walk out before stopping half way in the door frame, she turns to look back at you. “Until next time, and please do think about what i said, no one wants a lump of bones laying in bed with them.” Before she closes the door and walks away; job completed.
&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;

[[Go down stairs]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Go down stairs" tags="" position="1100,1200" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;switch $bodyC&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;

	Now fully dressed, you decide that it&#39;s now time to go down stairs to meet your parents. Going down stairs is something that you&#39;re not too fond of, partly due to the distance and due to the glances and stares you get from people. To get down to the courtyard you first have to go down stairs to the second floor of the keep, which isn’t a short walk considering the high quarters are on the top of the keeps central tower. Once you get to the second floor you have to walk down the main corridor, then down the main stairwell to the first floor, walk past the armory and guard quarters, continue down the corridor before you come to the keeps entrance that leads to the courtyard. For someone of your physical disposition that is no easy task. 

Thinking about the journey before you is easier thought than done; the first task before you requires you to waddle past your two royal guards and down the stairs. Your two guards, Henry and Wilson, are interesting characters to say the least. Wilson is the older of the two by some years and is the mentor and teacher for Henry. Wilson doesn’t much like you in the slightest. He thinks that you’re an overfed, fat, lazy pig who will run the kingdom into the ground if you ever got the chance. 

Henry thinks the opposite, he has a strange infatuation with you, something that pleases you tremendously considering that you are really only liked by a few staff of the castle. Henry is a very odd one to say the least, he always seems happy to help and especially happy to help you if it means he gets to be close to you. Despite how they might feel about you though, you know that both men would never let any harm come to you, besides the teasing from Gabriela which they are all too eager to let happen. 

You waddle over to the door, your dress immediately sticking to your sweaty fat and pulling itself tightly into all your folds of fat. The purple dress you’re wearing does nothing to hide your obese body, not that a body of your size could be easily hidden by a simple dress. You feel your lard jiggle and bounce slightly with every step as you lumber towards the door.  

You make your way over to your bedroom door, you take a deep, calming breath before you reach out and open the door. The door creaks open, giving you a view of the door opposite of your room, which would be royal aides quarters. You take another deep breath before starting out the door. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyS is &quot;Pear&quot;&gt;&gt;As you waddle through the doorway you feel your hips brush against the frame. Pretty soon and you’ll probably get stuck in the doorway. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;   

Exiting your room you emerge into the main hallway, to your left down the hallway a bit is a door that leads out to a viewing platform that overlooks the courtyard and city, to your right is the stairs that lead down to the second floor. The hallway is finely decorated with fur rugs, a few paintings, a few wooden console tables holding up various artworks or decorations. Some wall mounted torches provide a good source of light for the hallway, giving it a warm cozy feel. 

Standing at the end of the hallway to either side of the stairs are your two royal guards, well, you have more than two, but these two guard your private quarters. Henry stands on the left of the stairs, you can feel his gaze on your body, you can tell he would do just about anything to get a chance with you. On the right is Wilson, you can feel his gaze on you as well, though his gaze is rather neutral, really only looking at you because there is nothing else to really look at. 

You waddle down the hallway until you’re a bit more than two arms length from the guards. Looking at Henry you can see that he&#39;s young, probably not too much older than you, maybe 22 and that&#39;s pushing it. His face is young and youthful, still full of wonder and energy. His face is cleanly shaven, his eyes a bright hazel and a face that is unscared. He’s wearing a perfectly polished helmet with a thick gambeson hood underneath. He’s wearing a thick white body gambeson under his polished chain mail that itself rests under a masterfully sown surcoat. It’s purple and gold, it has your family crest emblazoned in the center chest, marking him as a royal guard. On his left hip is a short sword, which you imagine has been sharpened to the point you could shave with it. In his left hand is a metal shield that has been painted with the same color pallet and crest as his surcoat. The perfect soldier for defending a narrow staircase.  

Looking over at Wilson you see that he is dressed and armed in almost the same way, except he also has a small mace on his right hip as well as a greatsword slung over his back. An odd choice of weaponry considering that a great sword worn on the back might be difficult to draw in the tight couradoors of the castle, let alone wield it, but you’ll let the soldier do the soldiering. Wilson is a much older man than Henry, probably a good 20 years older, putting him in his 40s and making him quite the experienced man. Looking at Wilson you can tell that he isn’t a man to be trifled with. His face is peppered with white and grey stubble, his eyes are a deep hard blue and a scar runs from the temple of his face down to his jaw. 

Wilson gives you a slight bow as you approach, giving you a simple greeting. “Good morning, your highness.” Before he resumes his guarding position, standing at attention near the stairwell. 

Henry however takes a step forwards, entering into a deep bow, folding one arm in front of him and the other out behind him in a show of extreme chivalry. “Good morning, m&#39;Lady. It is always a joy to see your exquisite form at such a sublime hour. Might I say you look extremely beautifu-”

Henry&#39;s glazing was interrupted by the sound of a metal clang as Wilson steps over and slams his armored fist into Henry&#39;s helmet. Henry stumbles, catches himself and stands back up right. He looks back at Wilson, he goes to speak but Wilson glares at him, silencing the young man before he could even say anything. The silent argument ends in an instant and leaves Henry red with embarrassment as he returns to standing at attention near the stairwell. 

You can’t help but stifle a little laugh at what you just witnessed. Your little laugh leaves Henry bright red and a smile tugging at the corners of Wilson&#39;s lips. You can&#39;t help but find how cute it is that your royal guard is so easily embarrassed, you also find the two mens relationship quite cute as well. You sense an almost father and son relationship between them.

Deciding to make your way down stairs you start forwards going between the two guards and through the doorway that sits at the top of the stairs. The doorway is a couple inches thinner compared to the already narrow stairwell. You waddle a few steps as you start through the doorway.&lt;&lt;set $Rand1 to random(1,3)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Rand1 is 1&gt;&gt;Suddenly you come to a stop as your hips catch firmly, leaving you stuck.   

You try to walk backwards, however your hips stay firmly in place, stopping you from moving at all. You try to move forwards again, hoping that your hips might be suddenly dislodged, however you live in reality so your efforts have no effect on unsticking you from the doorway. 

You slump forward, admitting defeat. You feel your face growing redder as you realize that you’ll have to ask your royal guards for help. This had happened a few times before where you had managed to get yourself stuck in the doorway and Henry or Wilson had to help unstuck you. Though the idea of Henry, or Wilson, touching you didn’t sound like too bad of a prospect. 

&lt;&lt;if  $player.bodyS is &quot;Pear&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;   &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/PC/pear/stuck-intro.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyS is &quot;Apple&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;   &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/PC/pear/stuck-intro.png&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;   &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/PC/pear/stuck-intro.png&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Before you’ve built up the courage to ask for help you hear Henry’s voice call out to you. “M’Lady! Do you need help? I’d be more than happy to help a divine creature such as yourself out of this unfortunate position-” Henry is cut off by the sound of mental on mental clanging together.

“I think what Henry is trying to say is that if you need any help he would be happy to help.” You hear Wilsons level, professional voice follow the clang of what you assume to be Wilson hitting Henry on the head again. You can’t help but crack a smile at the duo that are your royal chamber guards. 

“Yes, I-I would like some help.” You still feel rather embarrassed about having to ask for help, even if help is offered. The fact that this has happened several times only furthers your embarrassment. 

“Oh, wonderful! Fear not m’Lady, I’ll have you out of this predicament in no time flat!” You hear a sign of defeat from Wilson, it seems that no matter how many times he rattles Henry&#39;s brains he still seems to be content speaking with an amount of cliche chivalry that would make any knight cringe. 

You hear Henry set down his shield before you feel his hands on your rear. You feel him pushing slightly as he gets into what you assume a position to better push you out. “Henry, what the hell are you doing?” You hear Wilson ask in a tone that holds genuine shock at whatever Henry is doing.  

“I’m just trying to help this sweet angel out of her unfortunate predicament.” Henry&#39;s reply brings a little smile to your face, as well as a slight bit of cringe at how cheesy that sentence was.   

“If you push her out of the doorway like that, and you don’t end up falling on her, you’ll go tumbling down the stairs. That&#39;s if you don’t accidently send the Princess down the stairs first.” Wilson says in a matter of fact tone.

“No I won’t, that&#39;s absurd! Trust me, in this position I’ll be able to unstuck her in no time flat! Alright, on three m’Lady.” You hear Wilson sign again.

“One.”

“Don’t do it Henry.”

“Two.”

“Seriously, that&#39;s a bad idea.”

 “Three!”

You feel Henry push into your back side with an extreme amount of force. You feel your hips budge before suddenly popping out of the doorway. You feel yourself go off balance as Henry continues to push you forwards towards the stairs. You suddenly feel yourself grabbed by the right arm, swinging you around towards one of the small outcrops that the royal guards stand in from time to time. Slowing you down just enough to stop yourself before falling over or slamming into the wall. 

Unfortunately for Henry he continued straight forwards, you hear him let out a yelp of surprise as he goes head first down the stairs. Turning around you catch a momentary slight of him as he tumbles down the circular stair well. You hear the sounds of stone on metal, bangs and clangs, as he tumbles down the stairs. 

Wilson steps all the way through the doorway and looks curiously at the stairs as he listens to the sounds of Henry making his way down them. “I hope the door to the low chambers was left open.” Right as he says this you hear a loud clang shortly followed by more clanging and banging that grows softer by the minute. “Sounds like the door was closed. I did warn him. He’ll be back up soon enough, once he reaches the bottom that is.”

You listen for a few more moments before you hear one more muffled thud, followed by a low groan. You hear silence for a few moments followed by the muffled sound of Henry’s voice. “I’m okay!” With that Wilson shrugs before walking back through the doorway and resuming his position. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Now standing on the small landing at the top of the stairwell you decide to start your descent down the winding steps. It’s a long walk to the courtyard, something that your massively obese body isn’t exactly made for. 

You take your fist step down the stairs, followed by another step and another step. Every step causes your bosom to jiggle and bonce. Your belly jiggles and wobbles underneath the fabric of your dress with every step. You feel the vibrations of each heavy step move up your legs and into your ass, causing it to jiggle.

Even though you&#39;re going down the stairs you can feel yourself starting to run out of breath. You feel embarrassed that even going with gravity your pathetic body still managed to struggle. You feel yourself start to sweat, your breath growing faster and more ragged. You can feel yourself dreading the walk that lies ahead of you, and more so the walk back. 

Finally you reach the floor below the high chambers, which is where you live. On this floor is where the low chambers are located. The low chambers are where the advisers of the kingdom live, such as the viceroy or royal engineer. You don’t spend any time on this level of the tower, because, well, you have no reason to. 

&lt;&lt;if $Rand1 is 1&gt;&gt; The door leading into the low chambers is made of strong solid oak reinforced with iron. The stairs you just came down lead directly towards the door. If the door was open when Henry went tumbling down the stairs he would have tumbled into the lower chambers hallway. Instead what happened is he hit the door, ricocheted off and went tumbling further down the stairs.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You take a moment to catch your breath on the small landing before continuing your journey. You feel your stomach rumble, it seems all this moving around has awoken your hunger. You hope that Mother and Father don’t take too long, you’d like to get some food in your fat gut sooner rather than later. 

	You once again continue your journey down the stairs. You quickly find yourself wishing for another place to take a respite, but you know that you won’t find such a place until you reach the bottom of the stairs. You’ve always hated the long winding steps from the high chambers down to the lower floors of the keep, though you’ve also always hated anything that involves walking too.

	Eventually you reach the bottom of the stairs, they lead into a wide hallway that has a long rug down the center and some decorations on the walls. For a hallway it&#39;s a pretty good hallway, though you think it would definitely have some improvements, namely some benches. 

&lt;&lt;if $Rand1 is 1&gt;&gt; On the floor off to the side of the stairs you spot Henry sprawled on the floor. His face looks a little worse for wear, though you imagine that falling down so many steps might have that effect on one&#39;s face. His eyes are closed, he seems to be resting before trying to make his way back up the steps.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You start once more wadding towards the courtyard. It takes you a few minutes of waddling down the hallway but eventually you come to another stairwell. It’s a much shorter stairwell, with it only descending one floor. From there it&#39;s only a little further to the keep’s entrance, which leads out to the courtyard.As you near the doors to the courtyard the two guards open the large, heavy doors for you.   

Waddling out into the courtyard you see the majority of the guard assembled. Their armor and helmets glimmering in the sunlight. Speaking of sunlight, it&#39;s a nice sunny day. The birds are singing, flowers are blooming, on days like this, girls like you should be… having a nice picnic, not standing around awaiting the arrival of your parents.

As the seconds turn into minutes you start to grow bored. You start to debate going back inside and eating when you hear a bellow from the gate house. “A rider approaches! It’s knight!” You hear the sound of metal stressing as the heavy grate raises open just as a single rider comes bolting through the gate. 

A single rider? The words echo in your head. The king and Queen&#39;s entourage consists of a dozen or more riders plus a carriage at least. A singer rider, a knight no less, merits cause for concern. The only time a knight would be sent as a messenger is if something terrible has happened.    

You see that it&#39;s a knight, he&#39;s riding a beautiful black horse. His armor glimmers in the light. As he nears however the sight of a knight in shining armor is quickly shattered as you notice several arrow shafts sticking out of the body of his stead. You now notice the horse barely keeping its breakneck pace as it leaves a trail of blood behind itself. The knight is in a similar state to his horse. You see his armor has been dented, arrow shafts are sticking out in the gaps in his armor, one in his shoulder and another in the elbow joint. His arm handing uselessly down to his side as his other arm holds the reins of his horse firmly, keeping it going only through will and duty alone. 

  He comes to a stop, skidding in front of you. His horse wobbles, lets out a small neigh, knowing his final task has been completed, before collapsing. The knight, not having the energy to move, goes down with his horse. Guards run over, removing the man&#39;s helmet and giving him some water, which he promptly spits out. You hear him croak something, one of the guards nods. “Your highness, he wishes to speak to you.”

You anxiously waddle over to hear what the mortality wounded man has to say. As you near you can hear him wheezing, he hasn’t got long you think to yourself. You lean down to better hear him as he starts to gently speak, his voice no more than a whisper. “King… Queen… dead… bandits… south… only survivor… me… we… we… failed.” 

The last word leaves his mouth with a shudder, as if the word itself deals him a final mortal blow. He shudders, takes one last shallow breath before his head collapses and his body goes limp. You know that he&#39;s gone.

You take a shaky step back, you feel your knees go out as you collapse to the ground. Your vision is blinded by tears, all you can think is that you have lost your mother and father. You feel yourself picked up and guided into the keep, a dozen faces go past your vision, their words melt together. You are consumed by grief.


&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;

Now fully dressed, you decide that it&#39;s now time to go down stairs to meet your parents. Going down stairs is something that you&#39;re not too fond of, partly due to the distance and due to the glances and stares you get from people.

	Thinking about the journey before you is easier thought than done; the first task before you requires you to waddle past your two royal guards and down the stairs. Your two guards, Henry and Wilson, are interesting characters to say the least. Wilson is the older of the two by some years and is the mentor and teacher for Henry. Wilson doesn’t much like you in the slightest. He thinks that you’re an overfed, fat aristocrat that cares more about her coffers than her kingdom. 

Henry thinks the opposite, he has a strange infatuation with you, something that pleases you tremendously considering that you are really only liked by a few staff of the castle. Henry is a very odd one to say the least, he always seems happy to help and especially happy to help you if it means he gets to be close to you.

You sense an almost father and son relationship between them.

The low chambers are where the advisers of the kingdom live, such as the viceroy or royal engineer. You don’t spend any time on this level of the tower, because, well, you have no reason to. 

You take a moment to catch your breath on the small landing before continuing your journey. You feel your stomach rumble, it seems all this moving around has awoken your hunger. You hope that Mother and Father don’t take too long, you’d like to get some food in your fat gut sooner rather than later. 

	You once again continue your journey down the stairs. You’ve always hated the long winding steps from the high chambers down to the lower floors of the keep, though you’ve also always hated anything that involves too much walking.

	Eventually you reach the bottom of the stairs, they lead into a wide hallway that has a long rug down the center and some decorations on the walls. For a hallway it&#39;s a pretty good hallway, though you think it would definitely have some improvements, namely some benches. 

You start once more walking towards the courtyard. It takes you a few minutes of waddling down the hallway but eventually you come to another stairwell. It’s a much shorter stairwell, with it only descending one floor. From there it&#39;s only a little further to the keep’s entrance, which leads out to the courtyard.As you near the doors to the courtyard the two guards open the large, heavy doors for you.   

Walking out into the courtyard you see the majority of the guard assembled. Their armor and helmets glimmering in the sunlight. Speaking of sunlight, it&#39;s a nice sunny day. The birds are singing, flowers are blooming, on days like this, girls like you should be… having a nice picnic, not standing around awaiting the arrival of your parents.

As the seconds turn into minutes you start to grow bored. You start to debate going back inside and eating when you hear a bellow from the gate house. “A rider approaches! It’s knight!” You hear the sound of metal stressing as the heavy grate raises open just as a single rider comes bolting through the gate. 

A single rider? The words echo in your head. The king and Queen&#39;s entourage consists of a dozen or more riders plus a carriage at least. A singer rider, a knight no less, merits cause for concern. The only time a knight would be sent as a messenger is if something terrible has happened.    

You see that it&#39;s a knight, he&#39;s riding a beautiful black horse. His armor glimmers in the light. As he nears however the sight of a knight in shining armor is quickly shattered as you notice several arrow shafts sticking out of the body of his stead. You now notice the horse barely keeping its breakneck pace as it leaves a trail of blood behind itself. The knight is in a similar state to his horse. You see his armor has been dented, arrow shafts are sticking out in the gaps in his armor, one in his shoulder and another in the elbow joint. His arm handing uselessly down to his side as his other arm holds the reins of his horse firmly, keeping it going only through will and duty alone. 

  He comes to a stop, skidding in front of you. His horse wobbles, lets out a small neigh, knowing his final task has been completed, before collapsing. The knight, not having the energy to move, goes down with his horse. Guards run over, removing the man&#39;s helmet and giving him some water, which he promptly spits out. You hear him croak something, one of the guards nods. “Your highness, he wishes to speak to you.”

You anxiously walk over to hear what the mortality wounded man has to say. As you near you can hear him wheezing, he hasn’t got long you think to yourself. You lean down to better hear him as he starts to gently speak, his voice no more than a whisper. “King… Queen… dead… bandits… south… only survivor… me… we… we… failed.” 

The last word leaves his mouth with a shudder, as if the word itself deals him a final mortal blow. He shudders, takes one last shallow breath before his head collapses and his body goes limp. You know that he&#39;s gone.

You take a shaky step back, you feel your knees go out as you collapse to the ground. Your vision is blinded by tears, all you can think is that you have lost your mother and father. You feel yourself picked up and guided into the keep, a dozen faces go past your vision, their words melt together. You are consumed by grief.

&lt;&lt;case 3 4&gt;&gt; 

	Now fully dressed, you decide that it&#39;s now time to go down stairs to meet your parents. To get down to the courtyard you first have to go down stairs to the second floor of the keep, which isn’t a short walk considering the high quarters are on the top of the keeps central tower. Once you get to the second floor you have to walk down the main corridor, then down the main stairwell to the first floor, walk past the armory and guard quarters, continue down the corridor before you come to the keeps entrance that leads to the courtyard.

	Thinking about the journey before you is easier thought than done; the first task before you requires you to walk past your two royal guards and down the stairs. Your two guards, Henry and Wilson, are interesting characters to say the least. Wilson is the older of the two by some years and is the mentor and teacher for Henry. Wilson doesn’t much like you in the slightest. He thinks that you’re a papered brat that spends more time looking at herself in the mirror than running a kingdom. 

Henry thinks the opposite, he has a strange infatuation with you, something that pleases you tremendously considering that you Wilson is one of the few people who doesn&#39;t like you. Henry is a very odd one to say the least, he always seems happy to help and especially happy to help you if it means he gets to be close to you. Despite how they might feel about you though, you know that both men would never let any harm come to you, besides the teasing from Gabriela which they are all too eager to let happen. 

You make your way over to your bedroom door, you take a deep, calming breath before you reach out and open the door. The door creaks open, giving you a view of the door opposite of your room, which would be royal aides quarters. You take another deep breath before starting out the door.

Exiting your room you emerge into the main hallway, to your left down the hallway a bit is a door that leads out to a viewing platform that overlooks the courtyard and city, to your right is the stairs that lead down to the second floor. The hallway is finely decorated with fur rugs, a few paintings, a few wooden console tables holding up various artworks or decorations. Some wall mounted torches provide a good source of light for the hallway, giving it a warm cozy feel. 

Standing at the end of the hallway to either side of the stairs are your two royal guards, well, you have more than two, but these two guard your private quarters. Henry stands on the left of the stairs, you can feel his gaze on your body, you can tell he would do just about anything to get a chance with you. On the right is Wilson, you can feel his gaze on you as well, though his gaze is rather neutral, really only looking at you because there is nothing else to really look at. 

You walk down the hallway until you’re a bit more than two arms length from the guards. Looking at Henry you can see that he&#39;s young, probably not too much older than you, maybe 22 and that&#39;s pushing it. His face is young and youthful, still full of wonder and energy. His face is cleanly shaven, his eyes a bright hazel and a face that is unscared. He’s wearing a perfectly polished helmet with a thick gambeson hood underneath. He’s wearing a thick white body gambeson under his polished chain mail that itself rests under a masterfully sown surcoat. It’s purple and gold, it has your family crest emblazoned in the center chest, marking him as a royal guard. On his left hip is a short sword, which you imagine has been sharpened to the point you could shave with it. In his left hand is a metal shield that has been painted with the same color pallet and crest as his surcoat. The perfect soldier for defending a narrow staircase.  

Looking over at Wilson you see that he is dressed and armed in almost the same way, except he also has a small mace on his right hip as well as a greatsword slung over his back. An odd choice of weaponry considering that a great sword worn on the back might be difficult to draw in the tight couradoors of the castle, let alone wield it, but you’ll let the soldier do the soldiering. Wilson is a much older man than Henry, probably a good 20 years older, putting him in his 40s and making him quite the experienced man. Looking at Wilson you can tell that he isn’t a man to be trifled with. His face is peppered with white and grey stubble, his eyes are a deep hard blue and a scar runs from the temple of his face down to his jaw. 

Wilson gives you a slight bow as you approach, giving you a simple greeting. “Good morning, your highness.” Before he resumes his guarding position, standing at attention near the stairwell. 

Henry however takes a step forwards, entering into a deep bow, folding one arm in front of him and the other out behind him in a show of extreme chivalry. “Good morning, m&#39;Lady. It is always a joy to see your exquisite form at such a sublime hour. Might I say you look extremely beautifu-”

Henry&#39;s glazing was interrupted by the sound of a metal clang as Wilson steps over and slams his armored fist into Henry&#39;s helmet. Henry stumbles, catches himself and stands back up right. He looks back at Wilson, he goes to speak but Wilson glares at him, silencing the young man before he could even say anything. The silent argument ends in an instant and leaves Henry red with embarrassment as he returns to standing at attention near the stairwell. 

You can’t help but stifle a little laugh at what you just witnessed. Your little laugh leaves Henry bright red and a smile tugging at the corners of Wilson&#39;s lips. You can&#39;t help but find how cute it is that your royal guard is so easily embarrassed, you also find the two mens relationship quite cute as well. You sense an almost father and son relationship between them.

Deciding to make your way down stairs you start forwards going between the two guards and through the doorway that sits at the top of the stairs. The doorway is a couple inches thinner compared to the already narrow stairwell. You walk a few steps as you start through the doorway.

Now standing on the small landing at the top of the stairwell you decide to start your descent down the winding steps. You take your fist step down the stairs, followed by another step and another step. Every step causes your bosom to jiggle and bonce. You feel the vibrations of each step move up your legs and into your ass, causing it to jiggle. While you don’t have much fat on you, going up or down the stairs still causes your assets to jiggle in that attractive way. 

Finally you reach the floor below the high chambers, which is where you live. On this floor is where the low chambers are located. The low chambers are where the advisers of the kingdom live, such as the viceroy or royal engineer. You don’t spend any time on this level of the tower, because, well, you have no reason to. 

You take a moment to stop on the small landing, just to think about what mother and father will do once they are home. They’ll probably hound you to continue your studies, or maybe they’ll talk about marriage again. Usually marriage is something totally decided by your parents, fortunately for you, your parents are radically free thinking and have decided that you are free to say no as you see fit.

	Eventually you reach the bottom of the stairs, they lead into a wide hallway that has a long rug down the center and some decorations on the walls. For a hallway it&#39;s a pretty good hallway, you don’t really have any complaints about it. 

You start once more walking towards the courtyard. It takes you a few minutes of waddling down the hallway but eventually you come to another stairwell. It’s a much shorter stairwell, with it only descending one floor. From there it&#39;s only a little further to the keep’s entrance, which leads out to the courtyard.As you near the doors to the courtyard the two guards open the large, heavy doors for you.

You lazily look around your room, seeing how the early morning light baskets everything in an almost magical glow. The sounds of the outside world start to set in as you wake up more and more. The sounds of far off birds drift to your attention, shortly followed by the sounds of hustle and bustle people in the courtyard down below.  You lay in bed looking at your ceiling for a few moments, you feel like something important is happening today, but what? Suddenly you remember: It’s your first day as Queen without any ceremonies or other fuss.

You then start to move towards the edge of the bed, which is hard considering your girth as well as the fact your weight has caused the bed to bow in the center, making it harder for you to maneuver yourself. Eventually you manage to get your legs over the side of the bed, which leads to your next challenge of the morning, which is standing up. You brace yourself before pushing off the bed with your hands and driving your heels into the floor and you struggle to lift yourself up, but you eventually manage to get upright. You swiftly, or as swiftly as you can, waddle to the door, your flabby body jiggling with every step, before pausing at the door; before you go down stairs you might want to cover up, you think to yourself.

You rise to a standing position and overcome with excitement you rush to your bedroom door, every inch of your chubby body jiggling with every step, before pausing at the door; before you go down stairs you might want to cover up, you think to yourself.

After a few moments of silence you see the heavy women open the door and enter the room. For the past two weeks, since the news of your mother and father passing she wisely chose to not tease you, after all, it wouldn’t be a great idea to make the new queen angry, epicly when she&#39;s still grieving.

She silently walks over to your wardrobe and grabs your dress before walking back over to you. You raise your arms and allow it to slide over your head and down your frame. She takes her time adjusting it as she goes, making sure it looks flawless. She seems to be paying extra attention today. Finally she stands up and takes a step back, surveying her work.

“You look more than fit to be the Queen. I know things have been rough on you recently, but you’ll be a great queen, or you won’t and all our heads will be on pikes.” She says with a smile. “Oh don’t give me that look, I’m only joking. Kinda.” She gives you a soft smile. “And don’t worry, I’ll start teasing you again, I’m sure you&#39;re starting to miss that.”

With that she turns and walks towards the door, she reaches out and opens it, starting to walk out when she stops midway through the doorway. She turns and looks back at you. “Seriously though, I prefer my head on my shoulders, not a pike. You need to focus on getting people on your side, most people don’t really like you.” With that final piece of advice she walks out and shuts the door, leaving you to decide what you want to do.

[[Start your first day as Queen|Bedroom]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Two weeks later" tags="" position="1200,1200" size="100,100">	It has been two weeks since you got the news of your parents murder, in that time you have grieved their loss, become queen and given them a proper burial. You’ve also received more news of their murder in this time.

Shortly after the knight brought you the news of their murder a force was sent out to investigate. They found the king and Queen&#39;s carriage, it was covered in arrows and surrounded by the dozen or so bodies of their royal guard. Inside the carriage the king and queens bodies were nowhere to be found.   

The king&#39;s body was eventually found resting near one of the wheels of the carriage; he wasn’t recognised at first due to the sheer volume of the cuts, stabs and arrow wounds that covered his body, leaving his clothes torn and his body mutilated. He died fighting alongside his men before he was struck down.

The Queen was found a few hundred yards away. It seemed that she had managed to escape the initial attack along with her handmaiden. However her handmaiden had taken an arrow to the leg, which slowed her down. When their bodies were found it looks like the queen and her handmaiden attempted to hide. It seems they were found and slaughtered; their bodies not touched by blade, insead when they were found hiding in a ditch they were simply shot with a dozen or so arrows. 

The deaths of both of your parents was executed with such hate and malice you have to wonder who could have done such a thing. It’s unusual for a king or Queen to die or be assassinated, especially once loved as much as your parents. 

When this news was brought back to you all you felt was rage and fury at what happened. You wanted to see the people who had done this burn. And you would have your revenge now that you’re queen. Though before you can go about doing that you must first secure your position on the throne.

Your coronation went smoothly, with you taking the title without any objections. You’ve spent most of your time acquainting yourself with the day to day tasks of being a queen. Most of the advisers that served your mother and father are no longer in your service. You’ll need to reassemble your advisers, whether it be old ones or new ones.   

After two weeks of grieving, coronations and learning the bare minimum you feel ready to actually start being the Queen, but before that you should get a good night&#39;s rest. You lay down in your bed and drift off to sleep as you think of what tomorrow holds.

The first thing that catches your eye are your horns. They’ve always been eye-catching; they’re thick and tall, like a crown given to you by nature. Your horns are the only part of you, besides your lower body. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, your $player.color1 scales for the most part are clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most they&#39;re shiny and new looking. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Looking at your chest you’re only met by mild disappointment. Your meager breasts barely manage to fill your bra. Their only saving grace is that their perky, though, it’s to be expected given how small they are. Supporting your below average boobs is your very average stomach. It&#39;s not entirely flat as a little bit of chub gives it a nice bit of padding. While no one would mistake you as being overweight or chubby, your tummy certainly wouldn’t be considered skinny. Even in your mid section you’re of average build. You’ve always been just average, as a kid you always tried to stick out by reading or learning, which, in turn, has made your intellect above average. 

Returning back to reality you let your eyes move downwards towards your lower body. While you’re mostly on the average side of things, your lower body however is anything but average. Your hips are wide and full, your thighs are thick and your ass is dress filling. Your thighs touch slightly, but leave a thigh gap just below your groin, though, it&#39;s more of a thigh window rather than a gap. You turn slightly to have a better look at your rear. Your royal purple underwear cling tight to your padded ass, reaching back to give your ass a slap and watch as it jiggles before it settles down. You also take the time to admire your thick tail and elegant wings.   

Turning back to face the mirror you give yourself one last quick once over. Overall you&#39;re fairly average, you have a bit more bottom then most women, but you’re lacking in the chest compared to most women so it evens out. Though, you can’t help but smile thinking about your superior mental capabilities.   

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
The first thing that catches your eyes is your $player.color2 hair. It’s always been eye-catching; it&#39;s smooth, shiny and pretty much flawless. Your hair is the only part of you, besides your lower body. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, well, by elven standards, your $player.color1 skin for the most part is clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most it&#39;s clear. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Looking at your chest you’re only met by mild disappointment. Your meager breasts barely manage to fill your bra. Their only saving grace is that their perky, though, it’s to be expected given how small they are. Supporting your below average boobs is your very average stomach. It&#39;s not entirely flat as a little bit of chub gives it a nice bit of padding. While no one would mistake you as being overweight or chubby, your tummy certainly wouldn’t be considered skinny. Even in your mid section you’re of average build. You’ve always been just average, as a kid you always tried to stick out by reading or learning, which, in turn, has made your intellect above average. 

Returning back to reality you let your eyes move downwards towards your lower body. While you’re mostly on the average side of things, your lower body however is anything but average. Your hips are wide and full, your thighs are thick and your ass is dress filling. Your thighs touch slightly, but leave a thigh gap just below your groin, though, it&#39;s more of a thigh window rather than a gap. You turn slightly to have a better look at your rear. Your royal purple underwear cling tight to your padded ass, reaching back to give your ass a slap and watch as it jiggles before it settles down.   

Turning back to face the mirror you give yourself one last quick once over.

Looking at the mirror the first thing that catches your eye is your height. &lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving on from your height you focus on the finer details of yourself, starting with your face. The first thing you notice is your $player.color1 scales, which look dimmer than normal. Your face is thin, your eyes are sunken into your skull, every bone in your face is on full display though your thin, tight scaly-skin. Your cheekbones stick out sharply and your cheeks seem to dip inwards as the scaly-skin struggles to stretch over the bone. Your lips are thin, no more than two wispy red lines that mark where your mouth is. Your jawline is sharp and perfectly visible as there is no fat or really any muscle to cover it. 

Below your jawline is your disgustingly visible neck, you can make out every little muscle, tube, tendon and vein. Your shoulders are much in the same boat with you being able to see every single bone and dip that should be filled with either muscle or fat. Your eyes follow the rocky curve of your shoulder down to your thin arms. They resemble noodles, well, boney noodles with thin bits of muscle and tendons packed tightly against your bones all wrapped in tight skin. Your forearms follow this disgusting trend of being thin as well. Your hands are bony and thin, each finger is nothing more than bone and skin that seems to be animated by an unseen puppeteer.   

Looking at your chest you don’t know what you were expecting but it definitely wasn’t what you were seeing. Your chest is completely flat with your rips clearly visible and your collarbone seemingly sticking out. If you didn’t know any better you might mistake your chest for a very, very underweight boy&#39;s chest.

Your stomach is concave, it looks like your body is sucking it in, desperately trying to get any scrap of fat that might be left on it. Your rips out line it, creating a rounded upside down V shape over your concave stomach. 

Deciding that you already have a pretty good idea of what your lower body looks like you decide to stop looking at yourself, there&#39;s no point in causing yourself to be further disgusted.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Recently you’ve added a few pounds onto your frame. Your arms, face, belly and chest have all softened as pudge has started to layer on. Your rear has expanded quite a bit, really showing off your body&#39;s natural bottom heavy shape. &lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

The first thing that catches your eye are your magnificent horns that protrude out of the top of your head like a natural crown. Looking downwards your eyes gloss over your shinny $player.color1 scales. Your face has filled out more, getting softer and looking less fierce. Your jawline has softened, becoming slightly less defined against your neck; if you get much fatter you have no doubts your jawline will become melded with your neck. Your cheeks too have much the same filled out with your prominent cheekbones now being buried under a small layer of fat, slowly hiding them away.  

 Shifting your gaze further downwards you let it glide over your neck and shoulders. They’ve softened, their features have become less defined as fat starts to layer on. Following the curve of your shoulder downwards your gaze comes to your upper arm. Here too the little definition you once had has quickly started to fade as the fat layers on. Your forearms are much the same, with their definition being covered by a growing layer of fat. Your hands for the most part are pretty much the same, maybe your fingers are a little thicker, but that&#39;s a big maybe.  

Redirecting your gaze to your chest you notice that not much has changed in that department. Your breasts are still small, barely filling your B-cup bra. They’re still round and perky, just not very big. The area around your breasts looks a bit softer, you notice that your bra digs into the flesh of your torso and sides a bit more than normal, but other than that you can’t really see any major difference. 

Moving your gaze downwards to your midsection you can really see the results of your weight gain. Your stomach has started to form quite the little belly and your love handles have expanded to touch your hips, making it look like your hips outline goes all the way up to your ribs. This gives you a clear bottom heavy shape, making you look like just half of an hourglass or a rounded triangle. 

Your hips have widened a bit with soft pudge, adding to your already wide hips by an inch or two. The extra width has forced, as well as the extra width your midsection has gained, has forced you to change your pantie game. You have a feeling that your hips, and the rest of you, is probably going to get a lot bigger soon if nothing changes. 

Your thighs have for the most part stayed the same size. They’re covered in a decent amount of fat regardless, giving them a nice little jiggle when you walk. They almost touch, and they would if not for the width of your hips. For the most part your thighs are pretty perfect with no signs of unscaled skin yet, though if you keep expanding like this you&#39;re bound to outgrow your current scales. 


Turning around you have a look at your wings. They look pretty much the same as they always do. They’re sleek and well muscled, easily able to support your extra girth, though they might not be able to for long if you keep porking up. Moving your eyes down your back you eventually come to your tail. It&#39;s long, slender and extremely strong, making it an excellent rudder for flying through the air. 

Looking down from your tail you see that it&#39;s resting on your largest asset. The first thing you notice is how your new panties struggle to contain its growing girth. It seems that by the time you fix an issue in one area of your clothing another area of you grows to create another issue. The fabric digs into your ass slightly, you can imagine that if you were to wear a tight dress the triangle indent your panties make on your ass would be clearly visible. Your ass jiggles and bounces slightly when you walk around, though when you go up or down the stairs it really jiggles, giving anyone behind you a nice little show. 

Turning back around you take one last brief overview of yourself. You’ve gotten fatter, that&#39;s for sure, and it looks like you&#39;re only going to keep getting fatter. Though you’ve found you rather enjoy the extra weight, you think it makes you look good and you honestly can’t wait to add some more weight to your frame.

Looking at yourself more closely, the first thing that catches your $player.color2 hair. Your hair is flawless and shiny, you go to great lengths to take excellent care of it. You brush it daily, leaving it devoid of any knots or frayed ends. By most race standards it&#39;s beyond perfect, but by elvish standards you do the bare minimum.  

Moving your gaze downwards you come to your face. Your $player.color1 skin is nearly perfect, it has no blemishes that can be seen, no acne, issues whatsoever, though it is slightly oilily, ever so slightly oilily which is why it&#39;s only nearly perfect. Your face is slim and elegant, well, slim and elegant by other races standards. Your jawline is just slightly too thick and soft, your cheekbones are not visible enough and your lips are far too fat. By elvish standards you have the face of an utter fatty.   

 Shifting your gaze further downwards you let it glide over your neck and shoulders. They’ve softened, their features have become less defined as fat starts to layer on. Following the curve of your shoulder downwards your gaze comes to your upper arm. Here too the little definition you once had has quickly started to fade as the fat layers on. Your forearms are much the same, with their definition being covered by a growing layer of fat.

You brush and wash it, but that&#39;s about it. You’ve never really taken the time to style it or really make it look anything other than presentable. 

Moving your gaze downwards you come to your face. Your $player.color1 skin is fairly plain with a few blemishes here or there, but for the most part it&#39;s plain. Your face has softened with your cheek bones definition becoming more murky under a growing layer of fat as well as your jawline.

You have a feeling that your hips, and the rest of you, is probably going to get a lot bigger soon if nothing changes. 

Your thighs have for the most part stayed the same size. They’re covered in a decent amount of fat regardless, giving them a nice little jiggle when you walk. They almost touch, and they would if not for the width of your hips. For the most part your thighs are pretty perfect with no signs of cellulite yet. 

Turning around to have a look at your largest asset the first thing you notice is how your new panties struggle to contain its growing girth. It seems that by the time you fix an issue in one area of your clothing another area of you grows to create another issue. The fabric digs into your ass slightly, you can imagine that if you were to wear a tight dress the triangle indent your panties make on your ass would be clearly visible. Your ass jiggles and bounces slightly when you walk around, though when you go up or down the stairs it really jiggles, giving anyone behind you a nice little show. 

Turning back around you take one last brief overview of yourself. You’ve gotten fatter, that&#39;s for sure, and it looks like you&#39;re only going to keep getting fatter. Though you’ve found you rather enjoy the extra weight, you think it makes you look good and you honestly can’t wait to add some more weight to your frame.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Recently you’ve been packing on the pounds onto your already filled out frame. Your greedy nature seems to have manifested itself in food; perhaps your part emerald dragon? Your recent gain has affected your ability to fly. Most of your weight has settled into your ass, belly and hips, adding to your bottom heavy build. 


The first thing that catches your eye are your magnificent horns that protrude out of the top of your head like a natural crown. Moving down to your face the first thing you notice is how round it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks have filled out, as well as your lips, giving you quite the plump face. The final nail in the coffin, condemning your face to its plump appearance, is your double chin that continues to grow thicker and thicker with each feast. Your jawline has all but disappeared, a few more pounds and it’ll have melded with your neck. Your recent habitats have led to your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; scales becoming too small for your expanding frame, leading to scales missing around your neck, cheeks and double chin as these areas have expanded the fastest. 

Going further down your eyes glaze over your neck, which has lost any details it once had, becoming layered in fat. Your shoulders are much in the same boat, with them too having fat layered on, hiding any details or signs of what little muscle you have. Following the curve of your soft shoulders don&#39;t you come to your upper arm. Your bicep has long ago been covered by fat, but your recent gains have caused something else to happen. Holding your arms out you watch as the fat sags down, your arms are starting to look more pillowy by the day, pretty soon they’ll be big enough to use as pillows. Your forearm is much the same with new layers of fat forming, hiding details of your form underneath. Your hands too have porked up, with you now having fat little fingers that look more like sausages, fat has even started to pool around your talons, than the clawed hands of a fearsome dragoness. 

Shifting your gaze to your center you see your small bosom, which really hasn’t grown much despite your weight gain. Your breasts are held comfortably in a purple bra that does its best to try to push them up and make them look as large as it possibly can, though it&#39;s not particularly good at its job. You can see that the straps of your bra dig into your soft flesh, it seems that you’re starting to out grow yet another bra. 

You bring a puddy hand up to your bra and give one of your megger breasts a squeeze; they’re very soft you conclude. Your cleavage isn’t very deep, though it&#39;s still deep enough to catch any stray crumbs that fall off your lips or that aren’t caught by your double chin. There is a part of you that wouldn’t mind having larger breasts, but another part of you doesn’t really want to have to deal with finding bigger bras or back pain.

Below your small breasts is your large double belly that constantly demands more food. The smaller of your two belly rolls supports your breasts, acting like a shelf for them to rest on, though they&#39;re not really large enough to need a shelf of that size. Your upper belly roll excels at collecting crumbs as it sticks out further than your boobs. Moving a plump hand to your belly roll you squeeze. 

You feel your warm fat ooze between your fingers as you squeeze. You give it a little shake, watching it, and the rest of you, jiggle slightly. As you watch your lardy form move, like the ripples on a pound, you can’t help but find an odd sort of pleasure in those feelings. You oddly enough find yourself longing to have your fat touched and squeezed and jiggled and slapped. You also feel a hunger, a hunger to get bigger; Fatter.  

Running your hands down your belly they soon come to your lower belly, which is the larger of the two rolls. It wraps around from your hips and love handles to your front, where it hangs down over your plump fupa. The two rolls are separated by a little crease, with your belly button sitting dead center between your two bellies. Your lower belly roll partially rests on your wide hips as well as hanging down over your fupa and your thighs, reaching to your upper thigh while standing. 

You firmly grab your lower belly, your fingertips reaching under its overhang and touching your moist skin. You give it a good jiggle, which causes your upper belly, breasts, arms, thighs and, well, all of you to jiggle. Again you get that feeling of pleasure as you do this, perhaps being fat is really starting to grow on you, figuratively and literally. After a few moments your flesh settles down and you return to looking at your plump form. 

Deciding to have a look at what might be under your belly you lift it up, which is fairly easy, but lifting up one&#39;s own just shouldn’t be anything other than just easy. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. It’s a large, well relative to what most women have, fat roll that protrudes and connects with your nethers. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;Looking closely at the thick lips of your entrance you notice that it looks like they’ve been recently wetted and ready for use. It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered, too bad you don’t know of anyone looking for a good time with their queen at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; 

Below your fat gut, with it partly resting on them, are your hips. Your hips are wide and covered in a more than generous layer of fat with an extra layer of fat put on top just in case. You constantly find yourself grazing doorways or bumping into furniture with your massive hips. Recently you’ve been having issues finding seats that are wide enough to handle you, though you’ve also ran into issues with them supporting you too. 

Following the curve of your hips downwards you come to your thick thighs. Your fat thighs leave no gap between themselves, almost touching all the way down to your mid thigh. Your thighs are mostly fat, causing them to jiggle with every one of your heavy set-steps. Along with this constant jiggling with every step you also have noticed that you’ve started to waddle a little. If your thighs get too much fatter you probably won’t be able to walk properly and instead have to waddle everywhere you go.

Having viewed everything that can be viewed from this angle you decided to turn around and have a look at your back and fat ass. You do a slight shuffle as you turn around, causing your belly to jiggle with the motion. Now turned around you turn your neck as far as it’ll go to see your backside, you can’t help but notice the rolls that form on your neck when you turn it at this angel. 

The first thing you notice is how your bra cuts deep into the fat on your back, causing it to fold over the purple bra strap slightly. Moving your arms up slightly you can see just how deep it cuts into your fat on the sides. You have no idea how your bra even manages to fit on you, but moreover how your bra will fit on you in the next few days. You have a feeling that it probably won’t. 

Protruding out just below your bra strap are your wings, neatly folded up on your back, ready for use if the time ever comes to fly. Your wings have gotten a little flabbier, you can see how they’ve thickened slightly. You imagine that flying is going to be a tougher task now that you&#39;re larger, you wonder if you could even lift yourself into the air.

Moving your gaze down your back you can see how your love handles wrap around to your back. They’re folds are the thickest on your sides but taper and blend into the rest of your back as they reach towards your spine. The worst part is that your protective scales that are supposed to line your back have all but been outgrown. You can tell how much bigger you are by looking at the gaps that have formed as well as the scales that have fallen off. You look at your back for a few moments, the fat seems to ooze between the gaps in the scales, trying to break them off or push them out of the way. So long as you don’t gain too much weight too fast your scales should grow back and adjust, I mean that&#39;s how it happens for emerald dragons so it’ll probably happen for you right? Right? For now at least you don’t have to worry about your back folds showing through your dress, though with your appetite that is bound to change.

Moving your gaze down a little further you come to the nice big shelf that your massive ass forms. Resting on top of that self is your thick tail that hangs down and over your blubbery ass. It’s gotten thicker; making it an even worse and more cumbersome rudder, though with all the weight you’ve packed on you don’t really need a rudder if you can’t even get off the ground. Looking down the first thing you notice is how your panties seem to be struggling to contain your massive rear. Your panties are firmly holding the line, causing them to press into the fat of your ass, creating an indent that&#39;s probably more than visible through a dress. Just like with your back the scales on your ass have been spread apart by your extra weight, some have even fallen off or been rubbed off by the friction created when your thick ass rubs against your dress. 

Reaching back you give your ass a nice firm slap. The first thing that surprised you is just how deep your hand sunk into the fat of your ass and the second thing was just how much it jiggled. You watch with great interest at how the fat jiggles around your scales, which don’t move as much. Your scales look like little islands surrounded by a jiggling sea of ass fat. You watched for a few seconds more as the fat on your ass slowly settled down. You can imagine just how much it jiggles when you walk or when you go up stairs. It wouldn’t mind having a view of that. 

Turning back around, you give yourself one last look over. Over all you’ve really been packing on the pounds with no end in sight, and honestly that makes you happy. You have no doubts that you’ll probably continue to expand and you have no doubts that you’ll probably enjoy becoming a fatter pig.   
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Recently you’ve been packing on the pounds to your elvish frame. Your once sculpted body has been buried under a fat double chin, a thick double belly and a big pillowy ass that jiggles with every not so elegant step. Most elves would at most be half your weight, but here you are, double the average and still growing. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;Hair&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving down to your face the first thing you notice is how round it&#39;s gotten. Your face was once sharp and refined: Now it&#39;s rounded, fat and piggish. Your cheeks have ballooned with fat, hiding your elegant bone structure underneath. Your lips have fattened, no longer the thin and delegate lips meant for singing hymns, instead all their good for now is holding in your mouth full of food and spitting out requests for more honey cakes between bites. Your jawline too has gotten flabbier, melting into your neck. You’re starting to look more like a lowly human subject than a refined elven queen. Byond just the layers of fat covering your beauty your skin too has started to reflect your gluttonous nature. Sweat, grease and oil has started to create a permeate shine on your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin, it&#39;s mostly concentrated on your brow.   

Going further down your eyes glaze over your neck, which has lost any details it once had, becoming layered in fat. Your shoulders are much in the same boat, with them too having fat layered on, hiding any details or signs of what little muscle you have. Following the curve of your soft shoulders don&#39;t you come to your upper arm. Your bicep has long ago been covered by fat, but your recent gains have caused something else to happen. Holding your arms out you watch as the fat sags down, your arms are starting to look more pillowy by the day, pretty soon they’ll be big enough to use as pillows. Your forearm is much the same with new layers of fat forming, hiding details of your form underneath. Your hands too have porked up, with you now having fat little fingers that look more like sausages than fingers of an elf. Your fat fingers would no longer be able to play a harp or lute with any dexterity or skill. Your hands and fingers are now only able to pleasure you with food and a crude touch that no elf, but you, would find any pleasure in.

Shifting your gaze to your center you see your small bosom, which really hasn’t grown much despite your weight gain. Your breasts are held comfortably in a purple bra that does its best to try to push them up and make them look as large as it possibly can, though it&#39;s not particularly good at its job. You can see that the straps of your bra dig into your soft flesh, it seems that you’re starting to out grow yet another bra.

There is a part of you that wouldn’t mind having larger breasts, but another part of you doesn’t really want to have to deal with finding bigger bras or back pain.

The smaller of your two belly rolls supports your breasts, acting like a shelf for them to rest on, though they&#39;re not really large enough to need a shelf of that size.

You feel your warm fat ooze between your fingers as you squeeze. You give it a little shake, watching it, and the rest of you, jiggle slightly. As you watch your lardy form move, like the ripples on a pound, you can’t help but find an odd sort of pleasure in those feelings. You oddly enough find yourself longing to have your fat touched and squeezed and jiggled and slapped. You also feel a hunger, a hunger to get bigger; Fatter. You find enjoyment in the fact that you’ll be looked down upon, made fun of, embarrassed by others for letting your form be replaced with this uncouth, piggish form. Something about the idea of becoming a fat pig ignites a fire in your nethers and the idea of being made fun of or insulted about it makes that fire burn hotter.    

Running your hands down your belly they soon come to your lower belly, which is the larger of the two rolls. It wraps around from your hips and love handles to your front, where it hangs down over your plump fupa. The two rolls are separated by a little crease, with your belly button sitting dead center between your two bellies. Your lower belly roll partially rests on your wide hips as well as hanging down over your fupa and your thighs, reaching to your upper thigh while standing. 

You firmly grab your lower belly, your fingertips reaching under its overhang and touching your moist skin. You give it a good jiggle, which causes your upper belly, breasts, arms, thighs and, well, all of you to jiggle. Again you get that feeling of pleasure as you do this, perhaps being fat is really starting to grow on you, figuratively and literally. After a few moments your flesh settles down and you return to looking at your plump form. 

Deciding to have a look at what horrors might be under your belly you lift it up, which is fairly easy, but the sheer fact that you even have to lift it feels you with disgust. You really are a bit you think to yourself as you lift it. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs, all of your disgusting rolls seem to be constantly coated with sweat. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. A fupa is an unheard of feature on elven women and the sheer fact that you’ve gotten to the point that your own sex has gotten fat is just more proof that you are no longer a graceful, beautiful creature, instead you are now nothing but a pig. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyhair lte 2&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a layer of recently shaven stubble. The fact that you can’t even reach down there to shave is pathetic. You are supposed to be the ideal beauty and here you are with a fat slit that you can’t even clean up properly.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice a layer of wetness seeping out of your plump sex, it would seem that all that jiggling earlier has made you needy. Is this truly what you have become? A fat whore who gets wet over seeing her figure destroyed? Pathetic.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 2 and $player.bodyhair lte 3&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a trim layer of hair. God, how could you have let it become this way? By elvish standards you are so disgusting you’re untouchable, let alone fuckable. It&#39;s bad enough your entrance is layered in fat, but to be covered by a forest, even if it is trim, makes you nothing more than a pig with the ability to speak.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As you stare at your unacceptable entrance you can’t help but notice that it looks damp. Is this turning you on? Oh god, have you really fallen to such a low level that this is arousing you? Your fear only feeds your arousal. You feel shame and embarrassment, and it only makes you wetter. Pathetic pig. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 3 and $player.bodyhair lte 4&gt;&gt; You feel like you&#39;re about to faint as you lay eyes on your fupa. It&#39;s covered in a thick messy mat of hair. Your entrance looks like one you might find on a breeding sow with how disgustingly barbaric it looks. How could that uncouth slit be on you? Is this what you have become? Is it that you’re too fat to reach or have you just become a pig without realising it? Perhaps maybe you aren’t even an elf and instead just a pig that resembled one until your nature took over and erased any sense of civility you might have learned?&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You feel your blood run cold as you notice that the hair around your cunt looks soaked. You feel your face burn red as you realize that you&#39;re soaking wet. God, is this really what you’ve become? A fat whore that gets soaking wet by her own lack of self restraint and will power? Does being a fat hog really make you all hot and bothered? You get your answer quickly as fire in your loins is spurred on by these thoughts. How did a pathetic piggy like you manage to get her fat ass on the throne? &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your fupa is smooth as can be, it&#39;s been freshly shaven with an extremely sharp razer, leaving you with no visible stubble. Well even if your form is piggish you at least retain the civility to keep your most delegate item well kept. Too bad all that lard surrounding it and laying your body will probably stop it from every getting used.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;Looking closely at the sickeningly thick lips of your entrance you notice that it looks like they’ve been recently wetted and ready for use. It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered. You are a pathetic pig, aren’t you? You like being a fat piggy don’t you? Your answer comes quickly as you feel the flames in your nethers fawned by these thoughts. You imagine yourself getting fatter and fatter, which only makes you wetter and more needy. Pathetic; you can shave as much as you want but you’re nothing but a pig.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;    

Below your fat gut, with it partly resting on them, are your hips. Your hips are wide and covered in a more than generous layer of fat with an extra layer of fat put on top just in case.

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Wolf-walker&quot;&gt;&gt;
Recently you’ve continued to pack on the pounds, adding to your already full frame. It seems that your attempts, if any, have ended in failure as you examine your larger body. Your plump form is quite bottom heavy, giving you a thick belly that hangs down, wide heavy set hips and a big pillowy ass. 

Moving down to your face the first thing you notice is how round it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks have filled out, as well as your lips, giving you quite the plump face. The final nail in the coffin, condemning your face to its plump appearance, is your double chin that continues to grow thicker and thicker with each feast. Your jawline has all but disappeared, a few more pounds and it’ll have melded with your neck.

You have no doubts that you’ll probably continue to expand and you have no doubts that you’ll probably enjoy becoming a fatter pig.                      

&lt;&lt;default&gt;&gt;

 &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;   &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/PC/pear/Plump-1.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Recently you’ve continued to pack on the pounds, adding to your already full frame. It seems that your attempts, if any, have ended in failure as you examine your larger body. Your plump form is quite bottom heavy, giving you a thick belly that hangs down, wide heavy set hips and a big pillowy ass. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;Hair&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving down to your face the first thing you notice is how round it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks have filled out, as well as your lips, giving you quite the plump face. The final nail in the coffin, condemning your face to its plump appearance, is your double chin that continues to grow thicker and thicker with each feast. Your jawline has all but disappeared, a few more pounds and it’ll have melded with your neck. Your recent habitats have led to your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin becoming greasy, with a slight shine of grease, and probably sweat, on your forehead. 

Going further down your eyes glaze over your neck, which has lost any details it once had, becoming layered in fat. Your shoulders are much in the same boat, with them too having fat layered on, hiding any details or signs of what little muscle you have. Following the curve of your soft shoulders don&#39;t you come to your upper arm. Your bicep has long ago been covered by fat, but your recent gains have caused something else to happen. Holding your arms out you watch as the fat sags down, your arms are starting to look more pillowy by the day, pretty soon they’ll be big enough to use as pillows. Your forearm is much the same with new layers of fat forming, hiding details of your form underneath. Your hands too have porked up, with you now having fat little fingers that look more like sausages than fingers of a fair lady such as yourself.

Shifting your gaze to your center you see your small bosom, which really hasn’t grown much despite your weight gain. Your breasts are held comfortably in a purple bra that does its best to try to push them up and make them look as large as it possibly can, though it&#39;s not particularly good at its job. You can see that the straps of your bra dig into your soft flesh, it seems that you’re starting to out grow yet another bra. 

You bring a puddy hand up to your bra and give one of your megger breasts a squeeze; they’re very soft you conclude. Your cleavage isn’t very deep, though it&#39;s still deep enough to catch any stray crumbs that fall off your lips or that aren’t caught by your double chin. There is a part of you that wouldn’t mind having larger breasts, but another part of you doesn’t really want to have to deal with finding bigger bras or back pain.

Below your small breasts is your large double belly that constantly demands more food. The smaller of your two belly rolls supports your breasts, acting like a shelf for them to rest on, though they&#39;re not really large enough to need a shelf of that size. Your upper belly roll excels at collecting crumbs as it sticks out further than your boobs. Moving a plump hand to your belly roll you squeeze. 

You feel your warm fat ooze between your fingers as you squeeze. You give it a little shake, watching it, and the rest of you, jiggle slightly. As you watch your lardy form move, like the ripples on a pound, you can’t help but find an odd sort of pleasure in those feelings. You oddly enough find yourself longing to have your fat touched and squeezed and jiggled and slapped. You also feel a hunger, a hunger to get bigger; Fatter.  

Running your hands down your belly they soon come to your lower belly, which is the larger of the two rolls. It wraps around from your hips and love handles to your front, where it hangs down over your plump fupa. The two rolls are separated by a little crease, with your belly button sitting dead center between your two bellies. Your lower belly roll partially rests on your wide hips as well as hanging down over your fupa and your thighs, reaching to your upper thigh while standing. 

You firmly grab your lower belly, your fingertips reaching under its overhang and touching your moist skin. You give it a good jiggle, which causes your upper belly, breasts, arms, thighs and, well, all of you to jiggle. Again you get that feeling of pleasure as you do this, perhaps being fat is really starting to grow on you, figuratively and literally. After a few moments your flesh settles down and you return to looking at your plump form. 

Deciding to have a look at what might be under your belly you lift it up, which is fairly easy, but lifting up one&#39;s own just shouldn’t be anything other than just easy. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. It’s a large, well relative to what most women have, fat roll that protrudes and connects with your nethers. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyhair lte 2&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a layer of recently shaven stubble. While it is difficult for you to shave down there you still manage with some difficulty, though you could, and have, asked for assistance.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice a layer of wetness seeping out of your plump sex, it would seem that all that jiggling earlier has made you needy.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 2 and $player.bodyhair lte 3&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a trim layer of hair. You haven’t shaved in a bit which would be why it&#39;s hairy. For now it&#39;s still well kept, though if you don’t shave soon it won’t keep trim for long.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice how the hair around your pillowy entrance looks to be a little damp. It would seem that all that belly jiggling and playing with your lard has made you ready for some action.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 3 and $player.bodyhair lte 4&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a messy tangle of hair, creating a thick and dense forest, ment only for the bravest of explorers. Your lack of shaving, or inability to shave, has led to your sex having a more natural, hairy state. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You notice that the thick brush of hair around your feminine entrance looks to be damp with excitement. This is probably the result of all that playing with your fat earlier, which has now led to you wishing a brave forest explorer was near. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your fupa is smooth as can be, it&#39;s been freshly shaven with an extremely sharp razer, leaving you with almost no visible stubble. You can visibly see your fat fupa, it looks like the perfect pillow or face rest for anyone who might be looking for a nice time with their queen.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;Looking closely at the thick lips of your entrance you notice that it looks like they’ve been recently wetted and ready for use. It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered, too bad you don’t know of anyone looking for a good time with their queen at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;    

Below your fat gut, with it partly resting on them, are your hips. Your hips are wide and covered in a more than generous layer of fat with an extra layer of fat put on top just in case. You constantly find yourself grazing doorways or bumping into furniture with your massive hips. Recently you’ve been having issues finding seats that are wide enough to handle you, though you’ve also ran into issues with them supporting you too. 

Following the curve of your hips downwards you come to your thick thighs. Your fat thighs leave no gap between themselves, almost touching all the way down to your mid thigh. Your thighs are mostly fat, causing them to jiggle with every one of your heavy set-steps. Along with this constant jiggling with every step you also have noticed that you’ve started to waddle a little. If your thighs get too much fatter you probably won’t be able to walk properly and instead have to waddle everywhere you go.

Having viewed everything that can be viewed from this angle you decided to turn around and have a look at your back and fat ass. You do a slight shuffle as you turn around, causing your belly to jiggle with the motion. Now turned around you turn your neck as far as it’ll go to see your backside, you can’t help but notice the rolls that form on your neck when you turn it at this angel. 

The first thing you notice is how your bra cuts deep into the fat on your back, causing it to fold over the purple bra strap slightly. Moving your arms up slightly you can see just how deep it cuts into your fat on the sides. You have no idea how your bra even manages to fit on you, but moreover how your bra will fit on you in the next few days. You have a feeling that it probably won’t. 

Moving your gaze down your back you can see how your love handles wrap around to your back. They’re folds are the thickest on your sides but taper and blend into the rest of your back as they reach towards your spine. For now at least you don’t have to worry about your back folds showing through your dress, though with your appetite that is bound to change.

Moving your gaze down a little further you come to the nice big shelf that your massive ass forms. The first thing you notice is how your panties seem to be struggling to contain your massive rear. Your panties are firmly holding the line, causing them to press into the fat of your ass, creating an indent that&#39;s probably more than visible through a dress.

Reaching back you give your ass a nice firm slap. The first thing that surprised you is just how deep your hand sunk into the fat of your ass and the second thing was just how much it jiggled. You watched for a few seconds as the fat on your ass slowly settled down. You can imagine just how much it jiggles when you walk or when you go up stairs. It wouldn’t mind having a view of that. 

Turning back around, you give yourself one last look over. Over all you’ve really been packing on the pounds with no end in sight, and honestly that makes you happy. You have no doubts that you’ll probably continue to expand and you have no doubts that you’ll probably enjoy becoming a fatter pig.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing your eyes focus on is your face. Your face is attractive and somewhat sharp, the main thing that sticks out to you is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; scales. You don’t take the greatest care of them, leaving some of them dull and there are a few spots where new scales have come in, making brighter spots, but it&#39;s not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards over your neck they come to your shoulders. Your shoulders are coated in a thin layer of fat that hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you have much muscle to hide any way. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a small layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes to your center your eyes land on your small breasts. Your breasts barely manage to fill your small B bra, leaving you with no cleavage and a chest that barely fills a dress. While your chest may be rather lacking you’ve found that your breasts are still quite eye-catching, as well as making your other ASSets look larger and more pronounced, and they’re very sensitive, which you often use in the heat of passion. 

Below you’re small bosom rest your large double belly. Your belly comfortably hands over the waistband of your panties and almost reaches down to touch your thighs, for the time being it simply obscures your chucky fupa. The upper roll of your belly would make for an excellent shelf for your breasts, if only your breasts were actually big enough to require, or even reach, your upper belly. Separating the two rolls of your belly is a sallow canyon with a deep hole that is your belly button right in the center. Wrapping around from your lower belly roll is a pair of thick love handles that rest lazily on top of your child bearing hips.  

Your hips are very wide, wider than your shoulders by quite a bit and well padded too. Most of your fat resides in your lower body, namely your hips, thighs and ass. Letting your eyes run over the curve you notice how the soft flesh divots from the waistband of your panties digging into them, the depth of these divots seems to constantly increase as the girth your panties are tasked with containing ever increases. 

Moving your gaze further down the outline of your hips your eyes soon come to your hips widest point before they taper down leading to your thighs. You let your gaze wander down the edge of your thigh before you move your gaze across the width of your thigh. You take note of the girth of your thighs and the soft, perfect flesh of your thighs. Your two thunder thighs smash together, you can’t remember ever having a thigh gap. Your two soft thighs seem to be fighting a savage war with each other for space as their ever expanding size demands more space. This has led to you having a very slight waddle as your thighs rub against one another.  

Deciding that you’ve inspected your thighs enough you decided to move on to your last, and best, asset; your chunky ass. Turning around and twisting your neck you’re just able to see your full moon. Your poor panties struggle to contain your ass, the poor fabric just manages to keep a tenuous grip on a triangle shaped area of ass. The fat is compressed in this area, highlighting your recent gains and giving the rest of your ass a larger appearance. Towards the lower part of your ass cheeks you see some cellulite that has started to form. Your posterior easily sticks out several inches from your back, if you so wished you could use it as a small shelf, though a jiggly wobbly shelf really wouldn’t be of much use. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam.

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is only a little soft, with filled out cheeks, rounded jawline and a softer chin, but nothing major like a double chin.

Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Your girth has only continued to increase as your gluttonous nature has continued to take greater and greater hold over you. This has resulted in you adding another few dozen pounds to your already overfilled frame. Your belly, hips, thighs and ass have taken the majority of the weight, with your hips, thighs and ass bearing most of the weight. Your belly has taken a good amount of the weight as well, adding to its big pillowy rolls. Along with your belly gaining weight your arms and face have ballooned up, only adding to your already pathetically fat appearance. Your breasts have only grown slightly, but their gains are undercut by the gains of the rest of you, making them look overall smaller. To make matters worse it’s gotten even harder to fly around and your physical prowess has all but vanished.   

The first thing that catches your eyes are the horns that stick out of the top of your skull. They have a unique beauty to them, something that can’t be replicated with metal and gold. Below your wonderful horns is your positively fat face that is the definition of gluttony. Your cheeks have become rounded and full of fat as your constant stuffing of your face has seemingly stretched them out. When most people hear that you&#39;re a dragon they think of a massive creature of incredible intellect and physical power, they usually only get the massive part right. Your jawline too has fallen victim to your unending gluttony, it has started to melt into the two bodies of flesh that are your neck and cheeks. Everyday, and meal, that passes it seems to become harder and harder to define as it sinks into the flesh of your body. The scales on your face have had some issues, many of them being brand new as the old ones fell off as your face expanded and many spots just don’t have your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; scales and instead are the exposed sensitive skin underneath.      

  Looking down from your piggy face to your neck you see how it melded partially with your jawline. Your neck itself has become an almost detailess cylinder fat jiggly fat that connects your fat face to your girthy body. Just like with your jawline your neck flows seamlessly into your shoulders. Your shoulders are coated in a thick layer of fat, any muscle you have left has been buried under a good inch, probably much more, of fat. You feel a great sense of shame knowing just how weak and physically useless. You spot your bra strap cut deep into your shoulder as it struggles to warp around you. Following the heavy curve of your shoulder you come to your massively obese arm. Currently your arm is resting against your side, its fat is pooling to either side of it, making it look wider than it actually is. 

Raising your arm out to your side, which is a lot harder than it has any right being, you see as the fat sags down to give you a nice pair of flabby wings. Moving your arm slightly you see as the fat jiggles. Bringing your other hand over you takes a squeeze of your bicep. Your fingers sink into it quite a ways before they hit the muscle buried under all that lard. Gosh, you almost can’t believe just how pathetic you’ve become, you probably couldn’t even do a push up, let alone a pull up. Putting your arm back down, moving your gaze to your elbow, it seems that your bicep has started to create a roll where it meets your forearm. Maybe you should start a bakery with how many rolls you have? You even have quite the cake to match.  

Looking at your forearm you see how remarkably similar it is to your bicep. While it isn’t nearly the size or girth of your bicep the amount of fat on it is still quite the morbid achievement. You squeeze your hand tightly expecting to see some movement from your forearm, unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your disposition, nothing visibly happens. Your forearm has grown to be about as thick as a normal person&#39;s bicep. Where your forearm meets your hand you can see that your wrist roll has grown a bit. 

Your hands have become further useless as more and more lard has been packed into them. Your knuckles are now little dents in the fat of your hand when you have your hand open, when closed they are indistinguishable from the rest of the fat on your hand. Your fingers have become fat little sausages, well, not so little sausages. Most of their dexterity has vanished, leaving them only good for gripping plates and shoveling food into your face, and maybe signing the occasional document but only if absolutely needed. The claws on your hands are practically useless with how much fat is packed around them.  

Moving your gaze to your chest the first thing you notice is how they seem to have not even really grown. Your breasts have grown slightly as they fill your bras cups more than they once did, however your other gains make theirs almost imperceivable. Your breasts sit snugly in your bra with them comfortably filling the cups. Your bra however struggles to fit on your properly as your back and side fat constantly threaten to rip the bra apart. Your cleavage is fairly small, but it&#39;s still enough to catch any crumbs that your lips fail to devour. 

Bringing one of your fat hands up to your chest you take a squeeze of one of your breasts. They’re quite squishy and very soft. They easily fill the palm of your hands, though that&#39;s not saying a lot. One thing you take note of is that your bra is slightly damp, if it&#39;s from grease from food or some other moisture is uncertain.      

Sitting just below your breasts and supporting them in the process is your upper belly roll. Your belly has divided itself into two separate rolls; a smaller upper roll and much larger lower roll. Your upper roll sits just under your breasts and supports them, though it&#39;s much larger than your breasts and it even sticks out a little bit more than your breasts do. Besides just supporting your breasts it also assists them in catching any crumbs that fall from your face. The large roll does an excellent job of catching stray crumbs.              

Moving your girthy hand from your breasts to your massive belly roll the first thing you notice is just how sweaty it feels. Your upper belly roll seems to be coated in a layer of grease, or at least that&#39;s how it feels. You take a squeeze of the fat roll, your fingers sink into the soft warm flesh as they squeeze. You feel a shot of pleasure as you squeeze, a pleasure of satisfaction. It makes you want to squeeze more and make sure there is plenty more to squeeze. It seems not having any scales on your belly, leaving the sensitive under skin exposed, makes touching it quite enjoyable, but it also means that you’re practically defenseless. 

Shifting your gaze down to your lower belly its most prominent feature is its size. It dwarfs your upper belly roll and dominates your upper body and naval areas with its sheer girth. The second thing you notice is its very attractive shape. It wraps around you from your hips, drooping down as it approaches your center where it hangs down the furthest. Something about that shape, that lovely arcing shape that your sagging belly forms, makes you love your belly a little bit more. Your belly at its lowest point only hangs down to about your mid thigh, but that&#39;s still enough to cause issues with walking or just generally moving around.  

Bringing your hands to the slides of your gut you put your fingers under your bellies overhang before sliding them towards the center of your belly. As you slide your fingers along the underside of your belly you feel how sweaty it is. You stop your hands a few inches from the middle of your belly. You take a squeeze of your belly, the fat oozes between your fingers as your squeeze tightens. Feeling your fat ooze through your fingers is an oddly pleasurable feeling. With your grip still firm on your belly you decide to give it a good jiggle. As your belly starts to jiggle more and more of your body starts to jiggle to varying degrees. Your watch has your flabby body jiggling. You love it, but not only that, you also love it. The feeling of your body jiggling is just the most wonderful feeling and the bigger you get the better it feels.  

Feeling your arms getting tired you let go of your belly, letting gravity take it. It slams back down causing it to slap against your thighs. As you stand there for a moment you decide to have a look at what might lurk under your belly. Grabbing your belly once more you lift it up so you can see your fupa in the mirror. Your fupa has become quite the mound of fat sounding your sex. Like a wall around a castle, well, a squishy wall that is easily bypassed and serves no real use. So really not like a castle wall at all. Deciding to have a better look at your fat fupa you let go of your belly for a second to pull down your panties a bit before lifting your belly back up. Your fupa forms a fat U-shaped pillow that shields your sex and provides padding as well. Letting one hand go from your belly you move it down to touch your fupa, which you almost can’t do. Your fingers sink into the softness of its fat flesh. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As your fingers explore your girthy fupa they touch something wet and warm. It would seem that somewhere buried under all your fat your pussy is in need of some attention. Perhaps you can find someone to help you out with that, or maybe just settle for some difficult self pleasure. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

With your arms getting tired you let your belly go, letting your fupa be eclipsed by your belly once more. Moving your gaze to your hips the first thing that strikes you is their shere width. They are incredibly wide to say the least, it&#39;s this width in fact that has gotten you stuck in quite a few doorways. Your hips sag slightly at their ends, though it&#39;s just barely a gentle curve downwards as your tree trunk thighs support them. Nestled between your love handles and your hips usually is where your panties waistband finds itself. 

Moving your gaze down the curve of your hips they flare out slightly as they meet your massively thick thighs. Your thighs are simply huge. They touch each other down to your mid thigh and have forced you to adopt a waddle when you walk. Along with this your thigh jiggle and wobble with every one of your heavy steps. When you sit down they, and your hips, spread out and take a massive amount of area. This is why you have been struggling to find chairs that can hold your width, as well as your weight. 

Deciding that you’ve seen all that your front has to offer you feel it&#39;s time to have a look at your backside. You shuffle around awkwardly, causing all of you to jiggle and wobble with every uneasy step. Finally turned around you struggle to look over your shoulder as your neck has gotten even fatter which is starting to inhibit your ability to turn it.   

Your upper back is covered in a thick layer of fat, though most of you is covered in a thick layer of fat as well. Looking down a little you see your bra strap cutting across your upper back, causing the fat to start to overhang it. The fat from your shoulder blades have almost completely hidden the bra strap on the sides of your back. The center of your back is the most relatively slim part of your back where your bra is the most visible. 

Just below your shoulder blades are your wings. The base of your wings have become coated in a layer of fat and lard, making moving them quite difficult. The once very thin membrane of your wing too has ticked by quite the noticeable amount. This makes flying a very difficult task, especially when you combine it with your extra girth. 

Moving your eyes down to your middle back you can see how your love handles start at your sides and then wrap up and around to the center of your back arching up as they do so. Besides that your middle back doesn’t really have anything to look at.

Finish looking at your middle back and lower your gaze to your lower back. Your lower back is where your girthy ass connects to your back. On your lower back, just above and resting on your ass, is your tail. Your tail at one point was a muscular rudder used to steer you through the air, now however it&#39;s nothing more than a fat cylinder that you have to drag around with you everywhere you go. 

Your ass sticks out several inches before arcing downwards and then curving down, rounding your ass and then connecting to your thighs. Because of gravity your ass doesn’t stick out as much as it could, but it still sticks out a surprising amount which is probably due to your massive thighs holding it up. Your asses sheer girth dominates your appearance from behind, and makes finding any chairs to sit in, well that can fit you, is a difficult task. 

Bringing a pudgy hand around to your rear you give your right ass cheek a nice firm slap. Immediately you feel your ass start to wobble violently, followed by your thighs and love handles, followed distantly by the rest of you. You watch the flesh of your ass wobble and jiggle for a few seconds. You can imagine that wherever you waddle around the castle your ass probably jiggles like this to some degree. You also take note of how good it feels to give your ass a nice little slap. 

With your ass’s jiggling coming to a stop you move your gaze to your very tight panties that are quite ill-equipped to cover your ass. Your panties cover most of your upper ass, well, as best as they can anyways. The triangle shaped area your panties cover compress the fat of your ass slightly as your panties struggle to contain the fat of your ass. As you examine the strained fabric of your panties you notice that some minor holes and tears have started to form in the fabric. It’d probably be a good time to get a new pair. 

Following the outline of your tight panties as they approach the apex of your ass you see how the fabric narrows as it finds itself wedged into your ass crack. While your panties were able to cover your upper ass they simply don’t have the capacity to cover all of it. Each one of your ass cheeks is massive to say the least, honestly you’re surprised that your panties can even cover your upper ass. You don’t really even notice when your panties get wedged between your ass crack at this point because of how consistently it happens. 

Overall you’ve really let yourself go, but honestly you’re starting to love it. You get to eat all day, sit around all day, plus being so fat honestly feels really nice. Though, the constant embarrassment of your weight is something that you’re not too fond of. You have no doubt that you’ll probably continue to grow and expand. You’re becoming quite the pig. 

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Gosh, you’ve gotten even fatter than you ever thought possible. You’re such a fat piggy that can’t stop herself from shoving food into her gluttonous maw that&#39;s utterly insatiable. The results are clear to see on your already way over filled frame. Your massive jiggling belly, door frame snapping hips, seam bursting thighs and chair squashing ass have received most of your new found girth, with your hips, things and ass gaining most of the weight. Your belly has taken a good amount of the weight as well, adding to its already massive amount of fat. Along with your belly gaining weight your arms have become pillowy with fat and your face has ballooned up, only adding to your pathetic piggish appearance. Your breasts are still pathetically small compared to the rest of you, though they have grown slightly, but their tiny gains are undercut by the gains of the rest of you, making them look overall smaller. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;Hair&quot;&gt;&gt;

Below your hair is your disgustingly fat face that seems to perpetually have some manner of crumbs or grease doting your fat cheeks or lips. Your brow is almost constantly sweaty, leaving a few tufts of your hair to become matted to your sweaty forehead. Your cheeks have filled out, taking you from looking like an overfed chipmunk to like you have a chipmunk in each one of your fat cheeks. Besides your cheeks just being generally fatter they have also become permanently redder, though you like the extra color in your face and the extra weight too. Your jawline has continued to melt into the surrounding flesh of your neck and face, it seems to be less and less distinguishable by the day; like a ship slowly slipping beneath the waves. The skin on your face has become disgusting, it&#39;s covered in a constant sheen of sweat, oil and crumbs, plus your skin now seems to be a near constant red or some like shade of red on your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin. Your face now fits the rest of your disgusting body as well. It reflects how you’ve let yourself go and embraced being a fat, disgusting pig. 

Gazing down from your piggish face to your neck you see how it has melded partially with your jawline. Your neck has become an almost detailess cylinder of jiggly fat that connects your piggy face to your girthy body, it also has started to inhibit your neck mobility. Just like with your jawline your neck flows seamlessly into your shoulders, adding to your fat appearance. You spot your bra strap cut deep into your shoulder as it struggles to warp around you. Gosh, you’re almost too fat for your bra strap. You&#39;re such a pig! Following the heavy curve of your shoulder you come to your massively obese arm. Currently your arm is resting against your side, its fat is pooling to either side of it, making it look wider than it actually is.   

Deciding to have a look at the wonderful layers of fat that have covered your arm you raise it, which is considerably harder than it has any right to be. You can see how the pathetic fat of your arm sags uselessly down giving you a pair of flabby wings. You move your arm slightly and watch as it jiggles and wobbles uselessly. Bringing your other hand over you take a squeeze of your bicep. Your fingers sink into your useless limb quite a ways before they hit the miniscule muscle buried under all that lard. Putting your arm back down, moving your gaze to your elbow, it seems that your bicep has started to create a roll where it meets your forearm. Maybe you should start a bakery with how many rolls you have? You even have quite the cake to match, though piggies aren’t really made for bakeries.  

Looking at your forearm you see how remarkably similar it is to your bicep. While it isn’t nearly the size or girth of your bicep the amount of fat on it is still quite the morbid achievement. You squeeze your hand tightly expecting to see some movement from your forearm, unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your disposition, nothing visibly happens. Your forearm has grown to be about as thick as a normal person&#39;s bicep. Where your forearm meets your hand you can see that your wrist roll has grown a bit. 

Taking a moment to think about how fat you’ve gotten you feel yourself getting excited. As an elf you used to hate very disgusting pound and roll, but now, you love it. You love how you jiggle and wobble. You love to stuff your face until your belly aches from being overstuffed. You love how much weight you’ve gained and how it&#39;s ruined your body, well, ruined is what you thought you did to it. Sometimes you still feel a tinge of disgust when you see a new roll, but more often than not you feel yourself get excited at the thought of a new roll and adding a few more onto it. 

Looking at your hands they have become further useless as more and more lard has been packed into them. Your knuckles are now little dents in the fat of your hand when you have your hand open, when closed they are indistinguishable from the rest of the fat on your hand.

Your girth has only continued to increase as your gluttonous nature has continued to take greater and greater hold over you. This has resulted in you adding another few dozen pounds to your already overfilled frame. Your belly, hips, thighs and ass have taken the majority of the weight, with your hips, thighs and ass bearing most of the weight. Your belly has taken a good amount of the weight as well, adding to its big pillowy rolls.

Your forearm has grown to be about as thick as a normal person&#39;s bicep. Where your forearm meets your hand you can see that your wrist roll has grown a bit. 

Your hands have become further useless as more and more lard has been packed into them. Your knuckles are now little dents in the fat of your hand when you have your hand open, when closed they are indistinguishable from the rest of the fat on your hand. Your fingers have become fat little sausages, well, not so little sausages. Most of their dexterity has vanished, leaving them only good for gripping plates and shoveling food into your face, and maybe signing the occasional document but only if absolutely needed.   

Moving your gaze to your chest the first thing you notice is how they seem to have not even really grown. Your breasts have grown slightly as they fill your bras cups more than they once did, however your other gains make theirs almost imperceivable. Your breasts sit snugly in your bra with them comfortably filling the cups. Your bra however struggles to fit on your properly as your back and side fat constantly threaten to rip the bra apart. Your cleavage is fairly small, but it&#39;s still enough to catch any crumbs that your lips fail to devour. 

Bringing one of your fat hands up to your chest you take a squeeze of one of your breasts. They’re quite squishy and very soft. They easily fill the palm of your hands, though that&#39;s not saying a lot. One thing you take note of is that your bra is slightly damp, if it&#39;s from sweat or grease from food.      

Sitting just below your breasts and supporting them in the process is your upper belly roll. Your belly has divided itself into two separate rolls; a smaller upper roll and much larger lower roll. Your upper roll sits just under your breasts and supports them, though it&#39;s much larger than your breasts and it even sticks out a little bit more than your breasts do. Besides just supporting your breasts it also assists them in catching any crumbs that fall from your face. The large sweaty roll does an excellent job of catching stray crumbs.              

Moving your girthy hand from your breasts to your massive belly roll the first thing you notice is just how sweaty it feels. Your upper belly roll seems to be coated in a layer of sweat and grease, or at least that&#39;s how it feels. You take a squeeze of the fat roll, your fingers sink into the soft warm flesh as they squeeze. You feel a shot of pleasure as you squeeze, a pleasure of satisfaction. It makes you want to squeeze more and make sure there is plenty more to squeeze. 

Shifting your gaze down to your lower belly its most prominent feature is its size. It dwarfs your upper belly roll and dominates your upper body and naval areas with its sheer girth. The second thing you notice is its very attractive shape. It wraps around you from your hips, drooping down as it approaches your center where it hangs down the furthest. Something about that shape, that lovely arcing shape that your sagging belly forms, makes you love your belly a little bit more. Your belly at its lowest point only hangs down to about your mid thigh, but that&#39;s still enough to cause issues with walking or just generally moving around.  

Bringing your hands to the slides of your gut you put your fingers under your bellies overhang before sliding them towards the center of your belly. As you slide your fingers along the underside of your belly you feel how sweaty it is. You stop your hands a few inches from the middle of your belly. You take a squeeze of your belly, the fat oozes between your fingers as your squeeze tightens. Feeling your fat ooze through your fingers is an oddly pleasurable feeling. With your grip still firm on your belly you decide to give it a good jiggle. As your belly starts to jiggle more and more of your body starts to jiggle to varying degrees. Your watch has your flabby body jiggling. You love it, but not only that, you also love it. The feeling of your body jiggling is just the most wonderful feeling and the bigger you get the better it feels.  

Feeling your arms getting tired you let go of your belly, letting gravity take it. It slams back down causing it to slap against your thighs. As you stand there for a moment you decide to have a look at what might lurk under your belly. Grabbing your belly once more you lift it up so you can see your fupa in the mirror. Your fupa has become quite the mound of fat sounding your sex. Like a wall around a castle, well, a squishy wall that is easily bypassed and serves no real use. So really not like a castle wall at all. Deciding to have a better look at your fat fupa you let go of your belly for a second to pull down your panties a bit before lifting your belly back up. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyhair lte 2&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a small layer of neatly shaven stubble. Your fupa forms a fat U-shaped pillow that shields your sex and provides padding as well. Letting one hand go from your belly you move it down to touch your fupa, which you almost can’t do. Your finger sink into its softness and are tickled slightly from the fine stubble that covers it.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As your fingers explore your girthy fupa they touch something wet and warm. It would seem that somewhere buried under all your fat your pussy is in need of some attention. Perhaps you can find someone to help you out with that, or maybe just settle for some difficult self pleasure.  &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 2 and $player.bodyhair lte 3&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a thick, albeit neat, layer of hair. Recently you’ve found it harder and harder to shave down there and it&#39;s extremely embarrassing to ask for help. Your fupa forms a fat U-shaped pillow that shields your sex and provides padding as well. Letting one hand go from your belly you bring it down to your fupa, which you almost can’t do anymore. Your fingers sink into the soft, fatty hair covered flesh of your fupa. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As your fingers explore your girthy forested fupa they touch something wet and warm. It would seem that somewhere buried under all your fat your pussy is in need of some attention. Perhaps you could find a forest explorer to help you out? Or maybe you’ll just have to settle for some good-old self pleasure.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 3 and $player.bodyhair lte 4&gt;&gt;  Your fupa is covered in a thick, messy jungle of unkempt hair. Recently you haven’t even bothered to shave, or even ask someone for help. Your fupa forms a fat U-shaped pillow that shields your sex and provides padding as well, though it&#39;s a little hard to make out specifics of your fupa’s shape due to how thick the hair is. Letting one hand go from your belly you bring it down to your fupa, which you almost can’t do anymore. Your fingers sink into the soft, fatty hair covered flesh of your fupa. The hair is thick and dense, you feel like your fingers don’t even touch your skin due to how thick the hair has grown. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;  As your fingers feel around your fupa they feel that some of the hair around the area where your buried sex is quite damp, bordering on wet. It would seem that your buried pussy is in need of some pleasure. Perhaps you could find a brave jungle explorer to help you out? Or maybe you might have to settle with the struggle of self pleasure.  &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Your fupa is clean shave and looks to be completely smooth. Your fupa forms a fat U-shaped pillow that shields your sex and provides padding as well. Letting one hand go from your belly you move it down to touch your fupa, which you almost can’t do. Your fingers sink into the softness of its fat flesh. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As your fingers explore your girthy fupa they touch something wet and warm. It would seem that somewhere buried under all your fat your pussy is in need of some attention. Perhaps you can find someone to help you out with that, or maybe just settle for some difficult self pleasure. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;     

With your arms getting tired you let your belly go, letting your fupa be eclipsed by your belly once more. Moving your gaze to your hips the first thing that strikes you is their shere width. They are incredibly wide to say the least, it&#39;s this width in fact that has gotten you stuck in quite a few doorways. Your hips sag slightly at their ends, though it&#39;s just barely a gentle curve downwards as your tree trunk thighs support them. Nestled between your love handles and your hips usually is where your panties waistband finds itself. 

Moving your gaze down the curve of your hips they flare out slightly as they meet your massively thick thighs. Your thighs are simply huge. They touch each other down to your mid thigh and have forced you to adopt a waddle when you walk. Along with this your thigh jiggle and wobble with every one of your heavy steps. When you sit down they, and your hips, spread out and take a massive amount of area. This is why you have been struggling to find chairs that can hold your width, as well as your weight. 

Deciding that you’ve seen all that your front has to offer you feel it&#39;s time to have a look at your backside. You shuffle around awkwardly, causing all of you to jiggle and wobble with every uneasy step. Finally turned around you struggle to look over your shoulder as your neck has gotten even fatter which is starting to inhibit your ability to turn it.   

Your upper back is covered in a thick layer of fat, though most of you is covered in a thick layer of fat as well. Looking down a little you see your bra strap cutting across your upper back, causing the fat to start to overhang it. The fat from your shoulder blades have almost completely hidden the bra strap on the sides of your back. The center of your back is the most relatively slim part of your back where your bra is the most visible. 

Moving your eyes down to your middle back you can see how your love handles start at your sides and then wrap up and around to the center of your back arching up as they do so. Besides that your middle back doesn’t really have anything to look at.

Finish looking at your middle back and lower your gaze to your lower back. Your lower back is where your girthy ass connects to your back. Besides your ass your lower back has nothing really to look at so you move right onto your ass.  

Your ass sticks out several inches before arcing downwards and then curving down, rounding your ass and then connecting to your thighs. Because of gravity your ass doesn’t stick out as much as it could, but it still sticks out a surprising amount which is probably due to your massive thighs holding it up. Your asses sheer girth dominates your appearance from behind, and makes finding any chairs to sit in, well that can fit you, is a difficult task. 

Bringing a pudgy hand around to your rear you give your right ass cheek a nice firm slap. Immediately you feel your ass start to wobble violently, followed by your thighs and love handles, followed distantly by the rest of you. You watch the flesh of your ass wobble and jiggle for a few seconds. You can imagine that wherever you waddle around the castle your ass probably jiggles like this to some degree. You also take note of how good it feels to give your ass a nice little slap. 

With your ass’s jiggling coming to a stop you move your gaze to your very tight panties that are quite ill-equipped to cover your ass. Your panties cover most of your upper ass, well, as best as they can anyways. The triangle shaped area your panties cover compress the fat of your ass slightly as your panties struggle to contain the fat of your ass. As you examine the strained fabric of your panties you notice that some minor holes and tears have started to form in the fabric. It’d probably be a good time to get a new pair. 

Following the outline of your tight panties as they approach the apex of your ass you see how the fabric narrows as it finds itself wedged into your ass crack. While your panties were able to cover your upper ass they simply don’t have the capacity to cover all of it. Each one of your ass cheeks is massive to say the least, honestly you’re surprised that your panties can even cover your upper ass. You don’t really even notice when your panties get wedged between your ass crack at this point because of how consistently it happens. 

Overall you’ve really let yourself go, but honestly you’re starting to love it. You get to eat all day, sit around all day, plus being so fat honestly feels really nice. Though, the constant embarrassment of your weight is something that you’re not too fond of. You have no doubt that you’ll probably continue to grow and expand. You’re becoming quite the pig.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Looking at yourself in the mirror you notice just how fat and weak you’ve gotten. Looking at yourself it&#39;s a little hard to believe that you’re even related to fearsome dragons. Your body has become bloated and saturated with fat as your muscles have all but vanished from what you can tell. Your face has further rounded with your double chin becoming more prominent. Every inch of your body has softened as your muscles vanish, leading to your arms and hands growing soft and flabby. Your breasts haven’t really grown much, but your belly, ass and hips have all ballooned with fat. You now have a waddle as your tree trunk thigh struggles to get past one another and your massive pillowy ass has been causing issues with hairs and dresses alike. While struggling to move at a reasonable pace is pathetic enough you also have started to have real issues flying with how heavy and sediment you’ve been.   

Looking at your face the first thing you notice is how bloated with fat it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks htoo have further porked up, starting to give you a chipmunk appearance or, more suitably, a greedy gluttonous appearance. A few dozen pounds ago you might have been able to pass for just overweight, maybe chubby, but your double chin has fully blossomed into a thick roll that seals your fat as a greedy fat ass than a physically impressive creature that demands to be fear; the only thing that fears you know is a feast. Your jawline continues to sink under the continuous waves of fat that coat it and the rest of your pathetically weak body. Beyond just your fatter appearance you also have seen changes to your scales. In particular your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; scales struggle to shed and regrow fast enough to keep up with your growing body. This has left much of your belly, ass, and thighs almost completely unscaled. To add to your now weakened state you also have lost any sort of stamina you once had. Just walking around leaves you slightly winded and god forbid you ever tried to run, you probably couldn’t even defend yourself from a human now, let alone another dragon. You’re truly in fat territory now. 

Moving your gaze down to your neck you see how it has continued to lose its shape as your jawline slowly melts into it and as it expands with fat losing the details it once had, just like your face. Your shoulders are much in the same boat with coating after coating of fat settling onto them, making them soft and squishy hiding everything underneath them, if there was much muscle under there to hide. Following the curve of your fat shoulders down to your upper arm you see how truly fat you, and your arm, have gotten. Your arm was once refined and muscled, now however it looks like a dinner ham stuffed into a scaly sleeve that is your arm. Holding out one of your arms you see how the soft flesh dangles off of your arm, giving you a second, flabby, pair of wings. Putting your arms back down and moving your gaze further down you see that a fold is starting to form between your upper arm and your forearm. You halt your gaze, shame fills you as the states of your arms fully sinks in. Your arms have become almost useless, used for nothing more than eating. Your arms are so pathetic that you probably couldn’t even do a push up at this point. Regaining your focus you move your gaze to your forearms. Your forearm looks alot like your upper arm with it having taken on a rounded shape and having no muscular details visible. A small roll has started to form where your wrist contacts your hand. Your hands too have packed on the pounds, with your knuckles becoming less defined and your fingers have plumped up into thick, fat sausages. The fat from your fingers has started to pool around the base of your claws. If your fingers continue to fatten up like this your claws will be useless, though with how weak your arms are they probably won’t be much use, except stuffing your face. 

Shifting your gaze from your disappointingly pathetic arms you move it towards your disappointingly small chest, it doesn’t even look like a single ounce of fat has found its way there. Your small breasts sit snugly in your bra that is able to hold your small bosom with ease, the only things that your bra struggles with is your fat back and sides that always seem to be expanding and as a result always threatening to rip the poor bra to shreds. 

Bringing one of your chubby, clawed hands to your bosom you take a squeeze of one of your breasts. They haven’t really changed much, compared to the rest of you, with them still being soft and squishy, just barely able to fill the palm of your hand. The only real thing that has changed was how much of your arm jiggles and sags when you move it. Your cleavage isn’t very deep, though it&#39;s still deep enough to catch any stray crumbs that fall off your lips or that aren’t caught by your double chin. There is a part of you that wouldn’t mind having larger breasts, but another part of you doesn’t really want to have to deal with finding bigger bras or back pain.
  
Just below your small breasts is your massive double belly, which has only gotten bigger recently. The upper roll of your double belly helps support your breasts, acting like a shelf for them, though with how small your breasts are you really don’t need a shelf. The other major function of your upper belly roll seems to be to catch any crumbs that your breasts fail to catch.

Bringing a fat hand to your upper belly roll the first thing you notice is how your hand sinks into your unscaled flesh, you’ve gotten so fat so fast that the scales on your belly, ass, thighs, hips have fallen off and new ones have yet to form. You push your clawed fingers into your warm soft flesh before taking a big handful of fat. You feel how the fat oozes between your fingers and claws as you squeeze, there seems to be more fat then there was not too long ago and that makes you oddly happy. 

Your lower belly dwarfs your upper belly roll; it overhangs your waistband by quite a bit with it even resting on your hips on the sides and sags down over your fupa on your front. Your lower belly, just like your upper belly, is scaleless. This makes your belly extremely soft, squishy and sensitive but also vulnerable as it means you now have a massive soft spot. Your lower belly steals the show from your upper belly as it is the most visible though your dress and has the habit to jiggle uncontrollably whenever you waddle your fat ass around. It also has the annoying habit of covering your fupa, which makes reaching down there a very difficult task. 

You grab your belly with both hands, you feel how soft and squishy it is and you even feel a little moisture on your underbelly. You lift it up slightly, it’s heavy, which surprises you how much effort you have to give in order to lift it up so slightly. You’re struggling to lift your own belly and some pathetic part of you likes that. You give your belly a good shake. Your whole body jiggles, giving you an odd feeling of pleasure that you absolutely love. Your shaking of your belly quickly stops however as your arms quickly grow tired from lifting and moving around the weight of your gut, which oddly arouses you. 

You let your belly go, gravity grabs it and slams it down against your thighs and fupa, causing you once more to jiggle and feel that pleasurable sensation. You watch your belly jiggle, how the fat bounces and moves, it&#39;s hypnotizing to watch the thick rolls of your belly and love handles move in such a magnificent manner. Maybe getting a bit fatter wouldn’t be too bad. 

Deciding to have a look at what might be under your belly you lift it up, which is fairly easy, but lifting up one&#39;s own just shouldn’t be anything other than just easy. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. It’s a large, well relative to what most women have, fat roll that protrudes and connects with your nethers. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;Looking closely at the thick lips of your entrance you notice that it looks like they’ve been recently wetted and ready for use. It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered, too bad you don’t know of anyone looking for a good time with their queen at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; 

Following the curves and folds of your sides downwards you soon come to your missive hips that support your love handles. Your hips stick out to either side of your waist by several inches, though the flare of your thighs sticks out a bit further, but that&#39;s started to shrink as the fat on your legs settles and sags. Recently you’ve been having more issues getting through doorways and finding chairs that are wide enough for you to sit in without getting stuck. 

Letting your gaze follow the outline of your hips downwards you quickly come to your tree trunk thighs. Each one of your thighs is probably about the width and girth of the average woman, give or take a few inches. Your waddle has only worsened as you’ve packed on the pounds and those pounds have found their way to your thighs. Your thighs are now touching halfway down to your knees, causing your thighs to rub as you walk, which has forced you into a wider stance in order to walk comfortably, though with your growing weight walking isn’t exactly comfortable and flying is just as uncomfortable as well as far more difficult.  

Deciding to have a look at your back and massive rear you shuffle around awkwardly, causing your lard to jiggle, until you&#39;re just able to see your back and rear. You’ve noticed that recently the growing fat on your neck has started to inhibit your ability to turn your neck to see behind you.   

Looking at your upper back you see how the fat of your back is trying to swallow up your bra strap. The rolls from your shoulder blades partially cover the poor strap in a sea of blubber, while fat from below the strap has also started to fold over onto it. Your bra strap has to take some of the blame for the position it finds itself in. Your bra strap cuts deep into the fat of your back as it struggles to wrap around your ever growing torse. 

Just below where your bra cuts deeply into the flesh of your back protrudes your wings. The base of your wings are buried in a bog of fat that makes flapping them difficult. Your wings themselves have gotten fatter if ever so slightly. You can tell that the once strong muscles have weakened and probably won’t be able to lift you for much longer. 

Letting your gaze move down your upper back and then to your mid-back. Your mid back has a couple of large rolls, two large rolls to be exact. These two rolls reach from almost the middle of your back downwards in an arc as they wrap around to fold into your love handles.  

On your lower back you spot your thick, flabby tail that sticks out behind you about three or four feet. You’ve mostly just been letting your tail drag on the ground as it&#39;s gotten fatter and harder and harder to lift. Your tail at one point was a solid mass of muscle meant to be a rudder to steer you in the air. Now it&#39;s just a big fat, sensitive cylinder of fat; completely useless.   

Your massive ass sticks out a few inches behind your back, creating quite the shelf; a big, jiggly shelf. Covering some of your massive ass are your panties, which are clearly not ment or intended to contain such a massive rear. Your ass, just like your belly, is devoid of scales as it has outgrown them completely. This has left your ass extremely sensitive and unprotected. Even something like a slap to the ass would feel a lot worse, or a lot better, as without your scales the nerves on your skin are a lot more exposed and more highly tuned to feel through your scales. They cut into your flabby ass, pressing into it at the top of your ass before they get sucked into your ass crack. You don’t think they could actually fit on your ass any other way as no matter how much you tug at them this seems to be their natural resting place. 

Each one of your ass cheeks is massive to say the least, with each one of them being the size of a pillow. Speaking of pillows, your ass makes for quite the pillow, making any sitting spot quite comfortable. The only issue with your massive ass is the fact that most chairs simply can’t contain it, or can’t hold you up. 

Overall you&#39;re quite the fatty now. You constantly stuffing yourself has led to you being quite the overfed pig. If you keep this up you’ll probably end up struggling to walk, that is if you don’t get too wide for the door first. But you seem to like the idea quite a bit, even if you end up a pathetic blob that can’t even take care of herself.  
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Looking at the reflection in the mirror it&#39;s hard to believe that you&#39;re of elvish blood. Your body is bloated with fat and greed. Your slim figure devoured by a ravenous monster with a lust for food. Your face is rounded with fat, your arms and fingers have been filled up like sausages, your belly hangs down over your feminine slit, your thighs are like tree trunks and your ass is monstrous in girth. Elves are supposed to be beautiful, temperate, modest creatures, you are none of these things. You are a fat, gluttonous, greedy beast who can never be satisfied and constantly stuffs herself.  

&lt;&lt;include Hair&gt;&gt;

Looking down at your face the first thing you notice is how disgustingly bloated with fat it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks bulge out with lard, making you look like a farmers prized pig; fat and juicy; ready to be turned into bacon, ham and pork chops. A few dozen pounds ago you might have still had some dignity , maybe even some semblance of self respect, maybe you could have even stopped this, however the thick roll that makes up your double chin indicates that you’ve lost any dignity, self respect and restraint. Your once sharp jawline has been dulled to the point of being unrecognizable, like a once sharp knife being used to cut something it wasn’t meant for. You weren&#39;t meant to be an elf, you were born to be a piggy. Beyond just turning yourself something that resembles a pig your skin has gone the extra mile to add those extra piggy details. Your once fair &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin is now coated in a constant layer of disgusting sweat and oil, especially on your browline. Not only this but your extra girth has resulted in your sweating beads that drench your clothes and skin whenever you do any physical activity, not to mention that you huff and puff under the strain of all those extra pounds.   

Moving your gaze down to your neck you see how repulsive it has become. It continues to balloon and melt under the constant stream of fat filling flowing into it. Your jawline has started to sag under the weight of the lard coating it, causing it to start to sink into the growing formless ocean that is your neck. Just like your neck and face your shoulder has fallen to the onslaught of lard that seems bent on blowing you up like dough in a hot oven. Following the curve of your blueberry shoulders downwards you come to your grotesquely fat arms. Raising one arm out to your side you watch as the fat hangs off it uselessly. Gone, or at least diminished, are the muscles of your arms. Your ancestors used to wield harps or grand bows with their slim, muscled arms. You however are only able to wield a fork, and even then you’ve fallen so far you often eat with your hands like a savage beasts than an elegant queen. 

Feeling your arms start to strain from being held out for so long you let them rest back at your sides. Your forearms have seen their fair share of fat piled into them. You clench your fist expecting to see your forearms tense up, or at least the fat move a bit. Instead you are might by a lack of movement. It would seem that your muscles have been so utterly covered, or diminished, that you can’t even see them flex under all that disgusting lard. 

A small roll has started to form between where your hand and wrist connect. The very fact that you’ve gotten so fat that your body has started to store fat here should be a worrying idea to anyone else, especially an elf. Instead you like it. You’ve let yourself go so far even your mind has been corrupted by all this lard and gluttony. A small, surface, part of you has been resistant, if minorly, but deep down you like this. You enjoy yourself expanding and seeing how your body copes with your gluttony. Your hands reflect this perfectly. Your palm has been softened, your fingers have filled up to such a degree that you struggle to move them with any sort of complex dexterity. Every pound you gain leaves you only able to gain more. Pretty soon all you’ll be able to do is eat, but that&#39;s what you want isn’t it piggy?    

Shifting your gaze, and mind, to your chest the first thing you notice is how disappointingly small it is, especially when compared to the rest of your form expanding it doesn&#39;t even look like it&#39;s grown. Your little breasts sit snugly in your bra that supports them with ease. The only thing that your little purple bra struggles with is actually reaching around your grotesque torse. Your sides and back have been generously coated with lard, which has forced your ill equipped bra into a fight for survival; a fight it will most certainly lose. Recently you’ve noticed that your underboob area, and the rest of you in general, has become especially damp with sweat. In fact you’ve been sweaty more and more than you should, either your metabolism has sped up or all that fat has been insulating you quite well. Looking at your recent weight gain though I think we both know that piggy’s metabolism hasn’t sped up in the slightest, so it&#39;s most certainly the latter option.  

Bringing one of your fat hands to your disappointing bosom you take a squeeze of one of your breasts. They haven’t really changed much, other than being sweaty and looking pathetically small compared to the rest of your massive frame. The only thing that has changed is how much your arm jiggles when you move it and how it grazes your gut when you move your arm to your breasts. Your cleavage isn’t very deep, though it&#39;s deep enough to catch any stray crumbs that your hungry maw doesn’t catch, plus your sweaty skin helps your cleavage keep hold of any crumbs. It would seem that you’re doomed to have small breasts, after all pigs aren’t known for having massive udders.  
   
Just below your meager breast is your massive double belly, which has only gotten even fatter due to your constant pigging out. The upper roll of your double belly helps to support your breasts, acting like a fat sweaty shelf, though with how small your breasts are they don’t really need a shelf. The other major function of your upper belly roll is to catch any crumbs that your breasts fail to catch. This often leaves your upper belly roll a disgusting mess of crumbs after every meal. 

Once again wanting to inspect your flab by poking and prodding it with a piggish hand. Touching your upper belly the first thing you notice is how it&#39;s sweaty just like your breasts, your skin seems to constantly leak out a thin layer of sweat. You push your fingers into your warm soft flesh before taking a big, disgusting, handful of putrid fatty flesh. You feel the flesh ooze between what little space there is between your fingers. There seems to be much more fat to grab on your upper belly roll than there used to be, and for some odd reason that makes you ever so slightly happy. The idea of adding more fat onto it makes you even happier, doesn’t it piggy?  

Unfortunately for you your upper belly roll is not the biggest roll on your belly, in fact it&#39;s nowhere close. Your lower belly roll overhangs your waistband by a significant amount with it resting on your hips on your flanks on the sides and sagging down over your disgusting fupa on your front. Your lower belly steals the show from your upper belly as it&#39;s far more visible through that poor dress you stuff yourself into everyday, it also has the most repulsive habit of jiggling uncontrollably whenever you walk. It also has the annoying habit of covering your fupa, which makes it oh so hard for piggy to reach her needy nethers.  

Prompted by morbid curiosity you grab your fat belly with both hands, you can feel how disgustingly sweaty your under belly is. You lift it up slightly, letting cool air reach your damp underbelly. It&#39;s heavy and has a loose form like dough ready to be baked. You feel yourself blush slightly, you’ve become desensitized to your body but the sensation of feeling your belly droop and sag fills you with shame; a shame that you oddly like. You continue to hold your belly for a second before giving it a good shake. Your whole disgusting body starts to jiggle, with ripples running across every inch of your fat flesh. Feeling your body jiggle gives you an odd sense of shame and pleasure that you absolutely love. The fact that you love it only makes you feel more ashamed, leading to more pleasure which starts to lead to you feeling hot and bothered, however your arms quickly tire of moving around the weight of your gut.   

Starting to tire you let your repulsive belly go. Gravity quickly grands it, slamming it down against your thighs and fupa, causing the rest of you to jiggle once more as well as feel that oh so pleasurable feeling. You watch your belly jiggle, how the fat moves and bounces, how your soft flesh ripples. You feel yourself being hypnotized by the blubbery flesh of your belly and love handles. The more you watch it the more you find yourself falling in love with it, and subsequently its devious spell. This isn’t you you think to yourself, but you can’t deny how badly you want to be fatter. To stuff your face. To burst out of all your clothes. To break the bed. You don’t care how big you get, you just want to be bigger. 

You take a moment to let your arms rest before grabbing your belly and lifting it up to have a look at your fupa underneath. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. It’s a large, well relative to what most women have, fat roll that protrudes and connects with your nethers.

You take a moment to let your arms rest before tentatively grabbing your belly once again. You want to see what horrors have become of your buried sex. You feel an odd sense of giddiness at imagining how fat and disgusting it’ll look. A part of you hopes that your fupa is huge and that your pussy lips are grotesquely obese. You hope that your nethers are piggish and reflect what you’ve become.

That final thought rings through your mind, silencing the world. What&#39;s happened to you? Is this what you’ve let yourself become? A fat whore hoping for her pathetic body to balloon up with more fat? You’re supposed to be an elf, a beautiful, elegant creature. Not this pathetic creature you see now, it seems even your thoughts have finally started to succumb to the fat and lard that fill every inch of your body. Have you really fallen so far as to not only enjoy it but want it?

 Returning to the moment you lift up your belly to have a look under it, you feel the cool air on your sweaty underbelly, and as you lift higher the air on your sweat-damped panties. Your fupa is shoved between your thighs and belly, its own fat roll struggling for space to grow. It&#39;s thick and protrudes out a little. It&#39;s definitely as big as you hoped for-you blush at the thought. N-no, that isn’t you. It&#39;s disgusting and repulsive. You should be, you are, ashamed to have such a disgusting roll around your nethers. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyhair lte 2&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a layer of recently shaven stubble. It&#39;s disgusting, you think meekly to yourself. You know you should feel disgusted and embarrassed, but truth be told you don’t care. Whatever part of you that used to care just simply isn’t there or has lost its steam. It&#39;s gotten difficult for you to shave down there, a fact that has started to arouse you more than-Why are you thinking like this? That little part of you that feels disgust and horror at what you’ve become briefly ignites, but it quickly fades; a final lash out before fading into a silence that only oblivion can manifest.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; As the silence fades you focus your eyes back on your stubble covered fupa, focusing particularly on your entrance which looks to be quite the wet hole. Seems all that jiggling of your lard has made you one horny piggy who could use some help. Reaching all the way down there is hard for a big girl after all. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 2 and $player.bodyhair lte 3&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a trim layer of hair. You haven’t shaved in a bit which would be why it&#39;s hairy. For now it&#39;s still well kept, though if you don’t shave soon it won’t keep trim for long.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice how the hair around your pillowy entrance looks to be a little damp. It would seem that all that belly jiggling and playing with your lard has made you ready for some action.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 3 and $player.bodyhair lte 4&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a messy tangle of hair, creating a thick and dense forest, ment only for the bravest of explorers. Your lack of shaving, or inability to shave, has led to your sex having a more natural, hairy state. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You notice that the thick brush of hair around your feminine entrance looks to be damp with excitement. This is probably the result of all that playing with your fat earlier, which has now led to you wishing a brave forest explorer was near. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your fupa is smooth as can be, it&#39;s been freshly shaven with an extremely sharp razer, leaving you with almost no visible stubble. You can visibly see your fat fupa, it looks like the perfect pillow or face rest for anyone who might be looking for a nice time with their queen.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt;Looking closely at the thick lips of your entrance you notice that it looks like they’ve been recently wetted and ready for use. It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered, too bad you don’t know of anyone looking for a good time with their queen at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;    

Following the curves and rolls of your sides downwards you soon come to your massively fat hips that support your thick love handles. Your hips stick out to either side of your waist by several inches, though the flare of your thighs sticks out a bit further, but those gains have started to slow down as the fat on your legs and hips settles and sags. Recently you’ve had more issues with trying to get your massive through doorways and finding chairs that are wide enough for you to sit in without getting stuck, or breaking the chair.

Letting your gase follow the robust outline of your pudgy hips downwards you quickly come to your tree trunk thighs. Each one of your thighs is easily about the width and girth of the average woman, probably more like double the width of an elf woman&#39;s waist, give or take a few inches. Your waddles have only become more exaggerated as you’ve continued shovel food into your ever fattening face, which much of that food turned fat has found its way to your thighs. Your massive thighs touch halfway down to your knees, causing your thighs to rub and touch with every step, which has forced you into a wider stance in order to walk comfortably, though with your growing weight walking has become harder and harder, making it all the easier for you to laze around on your fat ass.  

Deciding to have a look at your flabby back and massive pillowily rear you awkwardly shuffle around, causing your fat, flabby lard filled body to jiggle and wobble, until you’re just able to see your back and rear. Recently you’ve noticed that the growing amount of fat on your neck has started to inhibit your ability to turn your neck to see behind yourself, or really even look around in general.   

Looking at your upper back you see how the fat of your back is trying desperately to swallow up your bra strap. The fact that your back is so fat that it overflows your bra strap, threatening to pull it into its sea of fat, fills you with a lust for more. Your bra strap cuts into your back as it struggles to warp around the increasing girth of your torso. As you look at your bra strap you imagine growing so fat that it pops off of you, maybe it’ll even pop off around other people so they can see what a pig you are. You feel yourself blush at the idea. 

Letting your gaze move down your upper back and then to your mid-back. Your mid back has a couple of large rolls, two large rolls to be exact. These two rolls reach from almost the middle of your back downwards in an arc as they wrap around to fold into your love handles. 

Your lower back doesn’t have much interest to look at itself, however, your lower back meets your fat ass shelf. Your massive ass sticks out a few inches behind your back, though it would be more if your fat hadn&#39;t started to sag, creating a huge fat jiggly shelf. Covering some of your huge ass are your panties, which are clearly not ment or intended to contain such a fat ass as yours. Your poor panties struggle to fit over your ass, they cut into your flabby ass, pressing into it at the top of your ass before they get sucked into your ass crack. Your poor panties have started to give way under the constant pressure from your ass, little holes and rips have started to form as the fabric struggles under the girth and weight of your ass. 

Each one of your ass cheeks is massive to say the least, with each one of them being the size of a pillow. Speaking of pillows, your ass makes for quite the comfortable sitting pillow, making any spot you decided to sit your fat ass down on quite comfortable. The only issue with your massive ass is the fact that most chairs simply can’t contain it, or even hold you.

Overall you&#39;re quite the fatty now, in both body and spirit. You’re not sure what exactly has happened to you, but you feel yourself starting to accept and enjoy your lardy body more and more with no opposition. You constantly stuffing yourself has led to you becoming quite the overfed piggy. If you keep this up you’ll probably end up struggling to walk, or maybe even becoming immobile. You wouldn&#39;t mind being such a fat piggy that you can’t even walk, you think to yourself.

Looking at yourself in the mirror you notice how fat you’ve gotten. Your face has further rounded with your double chin becoming more prominent. Every inch of your body has softened, your arms and hands have gotten flabbier. Your breasts haven’t really grown much, but your belly, ass and hips have all ballooned with fat. You now have a waddle as your tree trunk thighs struggle to get past one another and your massive pillowy ass has been causing issues with chairs and dresses. 

&lt;&lt;include Hair&gt;&gt;

  Looking down at your face the first thing you notice is how bloated with fat it&#39;s gotten. Your cheeks too have further porked up, starting to give you a chipmunk appearance. A few dozen pounds ago you might have been able to pass for just overweight, maybe a chubby, but your double chin has fully blossomed into a thick roll that can’t be ignored. Your jawline continues to sink under the continuous waves of fat that coat it and the rest of your body. Beyond just your fatter appearance you also have seen changes to your skin. In particular your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin now boasts a near constant layer of sweat and oil on your brow, and if you do any physical activity you’re quickly drenched in sweat that runs down your face and stains your clothes. You’re truly in fat territory now. 

Moving your gaze down to your neck you see how it has continued to lose its shape as your jawline slowly melts into it and as it expands with fat losing the details it once had. Your shoulders are much in the same boat with coating after coating of fat settling onto them, making them soft and squishy as well as covering any of the details that now lay beneath. Following the curve of your soft shoulders down to your upper arm you can see how truly fat you&#39;ve gotten. Your arm is starting to look like a ham stuffed inside a pillow. Holding an arm out to your side, which isn’t too easy, you see how the fat hangs off your giving you a pair of flabby wings. Putting your arms back down and moving your gaze further down you see that a fold is starting to form between your upper arm and your forearm. Your forearm looks alot like your upper arm with it having taken on a rounded shape and having no muscular details visible. A small roll has started to form where your wrist contacts your hand. Your hand has gotten even fatter with your fingers starting to get too fat to stick flush with each other, causing your fingers to sit at a slight angle when you try to bring them together. Your hands have been losing dexterity at an alarming rate, pretty soon all they’ll be good for is stuffing your face. 

Shifting your gaze to your chest the first thing you notice is how disappointingly small your chest is, it doesn’t even look like it&#39;s grown at all. Your breasts sit snugly in your bra that is able to hold them with ease, the only thing your bra struggles with is your fat back and sides that threaten to rip it to shreds. Recently you&#39;ve noticed that your underboob area, and bra in general, has started to become slightly damp with sweat. In fact you’ve noticed that you’ve been sweating a lot more recently than normal, guess that extra weight has heated you up. 

Bringing your chubby hand to your bosom you take a squeeze of one of your breasts. They haven’t really changed much with them still being soft and squishy, the only real thing that changes was how much of your arm jiggles and sags when you move it. Your cleavage isn’t very deep, though it&#39;s still deep enough to catch any stray crumbs that fall off your lips or that aren’t caught by your double chin. There is a part of you that wouldn’t mind having larger breasts, but another part of you doesn’t really want to have to deal with finding bigger bras or back pain.
   
Just below your small breasts is your massive double belly, which has only gotten bigger recently. The upper roll of your double belly helps support your breasts, acting like a shelf for them, though with how small your breasts are you really don’t need a shelf. The other major function of your upper belly roll seems to be to catch any crumbs that your breasts fail to catch. 

Bringing a fat hand to your upper belly roll the first thing you notice is how sweaty it feels, your skin seems to be moist with a thin layer of sweat. You push your fingers into your warm soft flesh before taking a big handful of fat. You feel how the fat oozes between your fingers as you squeeze, there seems to be more fat then there used to be and that makes you oddly happy.

Your lower belly dwarfs your upper belly roll; it overhangs your waistband by quite a bit with it even resting on your hips on the sides and sagging down over your fupa on your front. Your lower belly steals the show from your upper belly as it is the most visible though your dress and has the habit to jiggle uncontrollably whenever you walk. It also has the annoying habit of covering your fupa, which makes reaching down there a difficult task. 

You grab it with both hands, you can feel how sweaty your under belly is. You lift it up slightly, it&#39;s heavy, like dough ready to be baked. You hold your belly up for a second before shaking it. Your whole body jiggles, giving you an odd sense of pleasure that you absolutely love. Your shaking of your belly quickly stops however as your arms soon tire from lifting and moving around the weight of your massive gut.

You let your belly go, gravity grabs it and slams it down against your thighs and fupa, causing you once more to jiggle and feel that pleasurable sensation. You watch your belly jiggle, how the fat bounces and moves, it&#39;s hypnotizing to watch the thick rolls of your belly and love handles move in such a magnificent manner. Maybe getting a bit fatter wouldn’t be too bad. 

You take a moment to let your arms rest before grabbing your belly and lifting it up to have a look at your fupa underneath. You feel the cool air touch the moist flesh of your under belly and upper thighs. Sandwiched between your thighs and belly is your fupa. It’s a large, well relative to what most women have, fat roll that protrudes and connects with your nethers. &lt;&lt;if $player.bodyhair lte 2&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a layer of recently shaven stubble. While it is difficult for you to shave down there you still manage with some difficulty, though you could, and have, asked for assistance.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice a layer of wetness seeping out of your plump sex, it would seem that all that jiggling earlier has made you needy.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 2 and $player.bodyhair lte 3&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a trim layer of hair. You haven’t shaved in a bit which would be why it&#39;s hairy. For now it&#39;s still well kept, though if you don’t shave soon it won’t keep trim for long.&lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You can’t help but notice how the hair around your pillowy entrance looks to be a little damp. It would seem that all that belly jiggling and playing with your lard has made you ready for some action.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $player.bodyhair gt 3 and $player.bodyhair lte 4&gt;&gt; Your fupa is covered in a messy tangle of hair, creating a thick and dense forest, ment only for the bravest of explorers. Your lack of shaving, or inability to shave, has led to your sex having a more natural, hairy state. &lt;&lt;if $player.lust gt 7 or $player.arousal gte 75&gt;&gt; You notice that the thick brush of hair around your feminine entrance looks to be damp with excitement.

It seems that all that playing with your gut and thinking about getting bigger has made you hot and bothered, too bad you don’t know of anyone looking for a good time with their queen at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;     

Following the curves and folds of your sides downwards you soon come to your missive hips that support your love handles. Your hips stick out to either side of your waist by several inches, though the flare of your thighs sticks out a bit further, but that&#39;s started to shrink as the fat on your legs settles and sags. Recently you’ve been having more issues getting through doorways and finding chairs that are wide enough for you to sit in without getting stuck. 

Letting your gaze follow the outline of your hips downwards you quickly come to your tree trunk thighs. Each one of your thighs is probably about the width and girth of the average woman, give or take a few inches. Your waddle has only worsened as you’ve packed on the pounds and those pounds have found their way to your thighs. Your thighs are now touching halfway down to your knees, causing your thighs to rub as you walk, which has forced you into a wider stance in order to walk comfortably, though with your growing weight walking isn’t exactly comfortable. 

Deciding to have a look at your back and massive rear you shuffle around awkwardly, causing your lard to jiggle, until you&#39;re just able to see your back and rear. You’ve noticed that recently the growing fat on your neck has started to inhibit your ability to turn your neck to see behind you.   

Looking at your upper back you see how the fat of your back is trying to swallow up your bra strap. The rolls from your shoulder blades partially cover the poor strap in a sea of blubber, while fat from below the strap has also started to fold over onto it. Your bra strap has to take some of the blame for the position it finds itself in. Your bra strap cuts deep into the fat of your back as it struggles to wrap around your ever growing torse. 

Letting your gaze move down your upper back and then to your mid-back. Your mid back has a couple of large rolls, two large rolls to be exact. These two rolls reach from almost the middle of your back downwards in an arc as they wrap around to fold into your love handles. 

Your lower back doesn’t have much interest to look at itself, however, your lower back meets your ass shelf. Your massive ass sticks out a few inches behind your back, creating quite the shelf; a big, jiggly shelf. Covering some of your massive ass are your panties, which are clearly not ment or intended to contain such a massive rear. They cut into your flabby ass, pressing into it at the top of your ass before they get sucked into your ass crack. You don’t think they could actually fit on your ass any other way as no matter how much you tug at them this seems to be their natural resting place. 

Each one of your ass cheeks is massive to say the least, with each one of them being the size of a pillow. Speaking of pillows, your ass makes for quite the pillow, making any sitting spot quite comfortable. The only issue with your massive ass is the fact that most chairs simply can’t contain it, or can’t hold you up. 

Overall you&#39;re quite the fatty now. You constantly stuffing yourself has led to you being quite the overfed pig. If you keep this up you’ll probably end up struggling to walk, that is if you don’t get too wide for the door first. But you seem to like the idea quite a bit.

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable. 

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Looking at your chest you see how small your breasts are relative to the rest of your corpulent form. Your small breasts are snuggly held in a bra that is too small for you, it&#39;s not that your breasts are too big for it, they fit perfectly in fact, insead it&#39;s the girth of your back rolls and side rolls that the poorly equipped bra struggles to cope with. You’ve had it expanded several times, but you’ve decided it&#39;s not worth the trouble or embarrassment, plus it&#39;s starting to get old and it&#39;s stained to quite the degree. It’s covered in grease stains, you barely wash the poor thing, in fact, besides the embarrassment, you rather like the feel of the dirty fabric. Your cleavage is small, but still deep enough to catch any crumbs that manage to escape your hungry maw.   

Below your small bosom is your, relatively, giant gut that dominates your torso. Your belly is separated into two rolls, the upper roll is the smaller of the two. Your upper belly roll holds up your small breasts and acts like a second net to catch crumbs on its greasy scales. Speaking of grease, you’re constantly covered in it; your scales are covered in a small layer of grease constantly, you prefer to wipe your pudgy hands on yourself rather than napkins. 

Your lower belly roll is considerably larger than your upper roll. It hangs down over your waist band, completely covering your fupa, and stops at about your mid-lower thigh. This makes waddling quite the task, which helps contribute to your lack of physical activity, and it does make pleasuring yourself more difficult, and exhausting. To either side of your titanic belly are a pair of thick, heavy love handles that rest on top of your wide hips. They help hold your panties in place, though with how tight they are they really don’t require any extra holding, as well as creating a very moist crevasse. 

Your hips are easily one of the largest parts of your body. They’re about two and a half feet wide, making most doorways a tight fit and servant doors impossible to pass, as well as making sitting in any chairs with arms an impossible task if they haven’t been made for your width. Your massive hips support a massive, jiggly ass and two tree trunk thighs. Your hips also make it a struggle to get your panties on or off, especially considering that they&#39;re too small already. 

Looking down at your thighs you see that they’re obstructed by your massive apron of a gut. Deciding that you are willing to put in the effort to have a look down there you lift up your belly, which is extremely difficult with your arms already burning after just a few seconds. As you lift your gut up you feel the cool air on the sweaty underside of your belly and on your thighs, and on your wet panties. 

The first thing that catches your eyes is the dark, stained, bulging triangle of purple fabric between your inner upper thighs. This fabric is what&#39;s currently visible of your poor, overworked panties. You can clearly see some staining, a lot of staining in fact. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after. 

Your thighs are thick as tree trunks, they’re mostly fat but they do have a decent amount of muscle to move your fat ass around. They’re in a constant war with each other for the limited space between your legs, forcing you to take a wider stance, which leads to you waddling, but even so your thighs still clash in a violent duel, taking up every once of space. Not to mention that the friction it creates makes waddling around even harder since you have to try to force them past each other.  Unable to hold up your gut any longer you let it drop, it impacts your thighs with a loud slap and sends reverberations around your jiggly body.   

You slowly turn around to have a look at your rear, which is quite difficult considering how fat your neck is. The first thing your eyes catch are your plentiful back rolls; you have enough rolls to easily fill a bakery. You spot your poor bra strap struggling to stay afloat in the ocean of lard that is your back. Below that you see your love handles come around to your back, forming two large rolls that meet in the center of your back. 

On your upper back, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up.

	A little above your ass, resting slightly on the doughy shelf it forms, is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. 

Just below your tail you come to the titanic shelf your ass forms; someone could easily use it as a very small desk if it was more solid and less saggy. Your panties struggle to contain your massive ass; looks like you have a large cake to go with your bakeries worth of back rolls. Your panties have a few minor tears that some of your ass fat oozes through. Your panties cling tightly to the form of your ass, following the curve perfectly, it even presses into the fat slightly, making your panties very visible in a clingy dress.

Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.            

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. You always took some pride in watching your parents squirm whenever they’d see it, you could always see the disdain in their eyes and you loved it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it anyways, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, especially your parents, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. This is something you take an odd pride in, considering that most elves have perfect, flawless skin, and here you are a disgusting slob; one of a kind. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable. 

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Looking at your chest you see how small your breasts are relative to the rest of your corpulent form. Your small breasts are snuggly held in a bra that is too small for you, it&#39;s not that your breasts are too big for it, they fit perfectly in fact, insead it&#39;s the girth of your back rolls and side rolls that the poorly equipped bra struggles to cope with. You’ve had it expanded several times, but you’ve decided it&#39;s not worth the trouble or embarrassment, plus it&#39;s starting to get old and it&#39;s stained to quite the degree. It’s covered in grease and sweat stains, you barely wash the poor thing, in fact, besides the embarrassment, you rather like the feel of the dirty fabric. Your cleavage is small, but still deep enough to catch any crumbs that manage to escape your hungry maw.   

Below your small bosom is your, relatively, giant gut that dominates your torso. Your belly is separated into two rolls, the upper roll is the smaller of the two. Your upper belly roll holds up your small breasts and acts like a second net to catch crumbs on its sweaty skin. Speaking of sweat, you’re constantly sweaty; your skin is covered in a small layer of sweat constantly and if you do any sort of physical activity, whether it be walking, standing up or even eating you start to build up quite the sweat, not to mention you quickly find yourself winded. 

Your lower belly roll is considerably larger than your upper roll. It hangs down over your waist band, completely covering your fupa, and stops at about your mid-lower thigh. This makes waddling quite the task, which helps contribute to your lack of physical activity, and it does make pleasuring yourself more difficult, and exhausting. To either side of your titanic belly are a pair of thick, heavy love handles that rest on top of your wide hips. They help hold your panties in place, though with how tight they are they really don’t require any extra holding, as well as creating a very sweaty crevasse. 

Your hips are easily one of the largest parts of your body. They’re about two and a half feet wide, making most doorways a tight fit and servant doors impossible to pass, as well as making sitting in any chairs with arms an impossible task if they haven’t been made for your width. Your massive hips support a massive, jiggly ass and two tree trunk thighs. Your hips also make it a struggle to get your panties on or off, especially considering that they&#39;re too small already. 

Looking down at your thighs you see that they’re obstructed by your massive apron of a gut. Deciding that you are willing to put in the effort to have a look down there you lift up your belly, which is extremely difficult with your arms already burning after just a few seconds. As you lift your gut up you feel the cool air on the sweaty underside of your belly and on your thighs, and on your wet panties. 

The first thing that catches your eyes is the dark, stained, bulging triangle of purple fabric between your inner upper thighs. This fabric is what&#39;s currently visible of your poor, overworked panties. You can clearly see some staining, a lot of staining in fact. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after. &lt;&lt;if $slobOp is &quot;Full&quot;&gt;&gt;You can also see a few hairs just barely sticking out of the edges of the fabric. Due to your size, and laziness, you don’t bother or care to shave down there, after all you don’t expect any visitors any time soon, or ever, despite your yearning.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your thighs are thick as tree trunks, they’re mostly fat but they do have a decent amount of muscle to move your fat ass around. They’re in a constant war with each other for the limited space between your legs, forcing you to take a wider stance, which leads to you waddling, but even so your thighs still clash in a violent duel, taking up every once of space. Not to mention that the friction it creates makes waddling around even harder since you have to try to force them past each other.  Unable to hold up your gut any longer you let it drop, it impacts your thighs with a loud slap and sends reverberations around your jiggly body.   

You slowly turn around to have a look at your rear, which is quite difficult considering how fat your neck is. The first thing your eyes catch are your plentiful back rolls; you have enough rolls to easily fill a bakery. You spot your poor bra strap struggling to stay afloat in the ocean of lard that is your back. Below that you see your love handles come around to your back, forming two large rolls that meet in the center of your back. 

   As your eyes drift downwards you eventually come to the titanic shelf your ass forms; someone could easily use it as a very small desk if it was more solid and less saggy. Your panties struggle to contain your massive ass; looks like you have a large cake to go with your bakeries worth of back rolls. Your panties have a few minor tears that some of your ass fat oozes through. Your panties cling tightly to the form of your ass, following the curve perfectly, it even presses into the fat slightly, making your panties very visible in a clingy dress.

Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

Your face is sharp, not an ounce of unwanted fat inhabits your face. Your lips are full, your cheekbones are high and quite prominent.

Your impeccable face is framed by your perfect and grand horns that give you an air of authority; like a crown given to you by nature.

You slide your eyes downwards. Your neck is thin and well defined, it trails down to your well defined shoulders and upper chest. Your shoulders lead down to well defined arms.

While they aren’t the largest breasts they make up for it with perknes and shape. 

Just below your breasts is your trim midsection. You can see the faint outline of abs on your midsection. Your sides are tight and follow your ribs tightly, giving you a slim waist. You can’t help but smile, your midsection is your pride and joy. Your average breasts and rear combined with your trim body make you extremely attractive, not to mention sexy. 

Speaking of your rear you haven’t given it a proper look over. Your hips are about as wide as you&#39;d expect for a woman of your size; about the same width as your shoulders. Your thighs are thin and muscular, a sizable gap separates them. You turn slightly to get a look at your rear. It&#39;s fairly modest, it has a rounded shape and is noticeable, it&#39;s just muscle covered by a thin layer of fat. A decently thick tail juts out over your ass, it&#39;s thick with muscle. Above your tail sticking out of your back is your wings, thick muscle adorns them, giving you the ability to fly fast and hard. Overall though it’s quite a nice lower body.
You smile, god you&#39;re good looking you murmur to yourself. You’ve always had a charm to you, plus your natural beauty, made it possible for you to always slip out of your studies as a child. I mean who needs to read when you can get anything you want with a wink and a smile, or if that doesn’t work threaten to turn them to ashes.

Your face is sharp, not an ounce of unwanted fat inhabits your face. Your lips are full, your cheekbones are high and quite prominent. The fur on your face is perfect; no discoloration or patchy fur here. Your impeccable face is framed by your cute and perky ears.

You slide your eyes downwards. Your neck is thin and well defined, it trails down to your well defined shoulders and upper chest. Your shoulders lead down to well defined arms. Bringing your eyes back towards your chest you’re met by your breasts. They comfortably fill your bra and provide you with a decent amount of cleavage. While they aren’t the largest breasts they make up for it with perknes and shape. 

Just below your breasts is your trim midsection. You can see the faint outline of abs on your midsection. Your sides are tight and follow your ribs tightly, giving you a slim waist. You can’t help but smile, your midsection is your pride and joy. Your average breasts and rear combined with your trim body make you extremely attractive, not to mention sexy. You start to hear the rithmic phwap of your tail wagging as the joys of being beautiful start to take hold deep in your chest.  

Speaking of your rear you haven’t given it a proper look over. Your hips are about as wide as you&#39;d expect for a woman of your size; about the same width as your shoulders. Your thighs are thin and muscular, a sizable gap separates them. You turn slightly to get a look at your rear. It&#39;s fairly modest, it has a rounded shape and is noticeable, it&#39;s just muscle covered by a thin layer of fat. Overall though it’s quite a nice lower body.
You smile as you turn back around, god you&#39;re good looking you murmur to yourself. You’ve always had a charm to you, plus your natural beauty, made it possible for you to always slip out of your studies as a child. I mean who needs to read when you can get anything you want with a wink and a smile?

Taking a quick glance at the mirror you see your trim body, perfect locks of hair and flawless $player.color1 skin. You can’t help but smirk, most women would die to have a body like yours, or at the very least work their asses off to maintain a body like yours.

The first thing that catches your eye are your horns. They’ve always been eye-catching; they’re thick and tall, like a crown given to you by nature. Your horns are the only part of you that would be considered exemplary or of any note, besides your intellect, maybe. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave the only physical part of you that is exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, your $player.color1 scales for the most part are clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most they&#39;re shiny and new looking. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving your eyes downwards to your chest you’re only met with mild disappointment, not disappointment at your breasts being particularly small, but rather them being infuriatingly average. They&#39;re not particularly perky, well, not any more perky then what one might expect of a woman&#39;s breasts. They’re shaped about what you’d expect when imagining a woman&#39;s bosom. Overall they&#39;re just average, nothing extraordinary. 

Your midsection is also just average. For the most part it&#39;s flat, it has a bit of padding but not enough to be considered overweight or even thick, just an average amount. Your navel is about as deep as you’d expect it to be, your sides are slightly padded, obscuring your ribs, but not to the point of giving you love handles. 

Your hips are about as wide as they should be for a woman of your size and age. Much the same can be said about your thighs. Turning around to have a look at your ass you find that it&#39;s exactly what you expected it to be. It sticks out a bit, but not enough to be of any particularly notable size. Just above your simple ass is your tail, it’s fairly thick and the scales on it are vibrant and new looking, but for a Dragon-folkis of your age it&#39;s, well, average. Looking up at your back you see your wings, which, just like your tail are average so you don’t even bother giving them a once over. 

Turning back around you sigh before looking yourself in the eyes. At least you have your intelligence you think to yourself, without that you really would average in every single way.

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
The first thing that catches your eyes is your $player.color2 hair. It’s always been eye-catching; it&#39;s smooth, shiny and pretty much flawless.

Looking at the mirror the first thing that catches your eye is your height. &lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving on from your height you focus on the finer details of yourself, starting with your face. The first thing you notice is your $player.color1 scales, which look dimmer than normal. Your face is thin, your eyes are sunken into your skull, every bone in your face is on full display though your thin, tight scaly-skin. Your cheekbones stick out sharply and your cheeks seem to dip inwards as the scaly-skin struggles to stretch over the bone. Your lips are thin, no more than two wispy red lines that mark where your mouth is. Your jawline is sharp and perfectly visible as there is no fat or really any muscle to cover it. 

Below your jawline is your disgustingly visible neck, you can make out every little muscle, tube, tendon and vein. Your shoulders are much in the same boat with you being able to see every single bone and dip that should be filled with either muscle or fat. Your eyes follow the rocky curve of your shoulder down to your thin arms. They resemble noodles, well, boney noodles with thin bits of muscle and tendons packed tightly against your bones all wrapped in tight skin. Your forearms follow this disgusting trend of being thin as well. Your hands are bony and thin, each finger is nothing more than bone and skin that seems to be animated by an unseen puppeteer.   

Looking at your chest you don’t know what you were expecting but it definitely wasn’t what you were seeing. Your chest is completely flat with your rips clearly visible and your collarbone seemingly sticking out. If you didn’t know any better you might mistake your chest for a very, very underweight boy&#39;s chest.

Your stomach is concave, it looks like your body is sucking it in, desperately trying to get any scrap of fat that might be left on it. Your rips out line it, creating a rounded upside down V shape over your concave stomach. 

Deciding that you already have a pretty good idea of what your lower body looks like you decide to stop looking at yourself, there&#39;s no point in causing yourself to be further disgusted.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing your eyes focus on is your face. Your face is attractive and somewhat sharp, the main thing that sticks out to you is your $player.color1 scales. You don’t take the greatest care of them, leaving some of them dull and there are a few spots where new scales have come in, making brighter spots, but it&#39;s not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Bringing your eyes to your center your eyes land on your small breasts. Your breasts barely manage to fill your small B bra, leaving you with no cleavage and a chest that barely fills a dress. While your chest may be rather lacking you’ve found that your breasts are still quite eye-catching, as well as making your other assets look larger and more pronounced, and they’re very sensitive, which you often use in the heat of passion.

Your belly is a massive apron of fat that distends out in front of you and hangs down onto your thighs. It’s one large continuous roll of fat that dangles off of your body and shoots out in front of you. Right in the middle of your belly lower down is your cavern of a belly button. It’s a deep dark, warm hole, that you’ve found to be surprisingly sensitive in moments of passion. You’re belly is joined on either side by a pair of thick love handles that stretch out most dresses you wear.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Just above your ass is your tail, it&#39;s thick with jiggly fat and is about two feet in length. Due to the flabby nature of your tail it&#39;s thicker than it should be, which leads to it being a subpar rudder in the air.    

Above your tail, towards your upper back, is a nice pair of wings. Your wings have a slight layer of pudge at their base, but for the most part are fairly toned and muscular, allowing you to fly fairly well even with your increased weight. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam. 
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes to your center your eyes land on your small breasts. Your breasts barely manage to fill your small B bra, leaving you with no cleavage and a chest that barely fills a dress. While your chest may be rather lacking you’ve found that your breasts are still quite eye-catching, as well as making your other assets look larger and more pronounced, and they’re very sensitive, which you often use in the heat of passion.

It’s one large continuous roll of fat that dangles off of your body and shoots out in front of you. Right in the middle of your belly lower down is your cavern of a belly button. It’s a deep dark, warm hole, that you’ve found to be surprisingly sensitive in moments of passion. You’re belly is joined on either side by a pair of thick love handles that stretch out most dresses you wear.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam.

Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your mediocre  &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; fur, which has some greasy spots and some patchy spots, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips.

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes to your center your eyes land on your small breasts. Your breasts barely manage to fill your small B bra, leaving you with no cleavage and a chest that barely fills a dress.

Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty.

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing back on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Your bosom is of a decent size compared to your girth. Your breasts rest on top of your apron of a gut, they stick out about half of the distance that your fat belly does. The bra your breasts fill is covered in grease and food stains, markings of prior feasts. The cavern of your cleavage isn’t much better. Deep in its depths grease covered crumbs have been buried, the tops on your breasts tell a similar story with crumbs, spots of sauce and grease littering their soft, squishy flesh. 

Below your bosom is your massive apron of a gut, really apron is too small of a turn, it&#39;s more like a great fleshy gate that seals away your royal fupa and aristocratic thighs. Your belly is one massive roll that is surprisingly perky given its size. Your belly button is a deep damp hole located somewhere on your gut, the location is of no value to you ever since you became unable to reach the front of your globular gut. Your belly sags down to your mid thigh, hiding everything underneath, creating a sweaty fold that rarely sees the light of day unless you&#39;re pawing desperately at your needy sex. Your belly is covered in a constant shine of grease. To either side of your flabby gut is a thick love handle that juts out past your hips by quite a bit. Your love handles are thick rolls that reach around from your sides to your back, folding over your hips slightly along the way.   

Deciding you want to have a look at your fupa and thighs you lift up your belly, which is no easy task. You feel the muscles in your arm strain as you struggle to lift your massive gut up, revealing your thighs and fupa. You feel the cool air on your thighs and underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, or would be a nice pillow if your belly wasn’t there to suffocate anyone who might want to use it as such. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun. 

Unable to hold up your tubby gut any longer you let gravity have its victory, causing your belly to slap into your thighs with a loud, fleshy slap that sends your whole body jiggling. Turning your gaze to the part of your tights still visible you see how they struggle for space. They’re locked in a war for space, this is mostly caused by your rather average hips and your far above average girth. Your thighs force you to waddle wherever you go, which makes walking one of your least favorite tasks, especially considering that you also have to fight your belly for every step as it pushes down on your legs. 

  Turning around to have a look at your rear the first thing that catches your eyes is your fat back. On your upper back, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up. Your back is thick with fat around your lower neck and shoulders, your shoulder blades have a roll that goes from the middle of your back and curves down towards your sides. Near the trough of the roll you see your love hands have a roll just below it. The roll from your love handles curves up from your hips and towards the center of your lower back. Just below these rolls you see your pudgy tail sticking out just above your ass. 

A little above your ass is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Speaking of cake yours is rather lacking, looking down from your back and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. You always took some pride in watching your parents squirm whenever they’d see it, you could always see the disdain in their eyes and you loved it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it anyways, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, especially your parents, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. This is something you take an odd pride in, considering that most elves have perfect, flawless skin, and here you are a disgusting slob; one of a kind. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture.

Your belly is covered in a constant shine of grease. To either side of your flabby gut is a thick love handle that juts out past your hips by quite a bit. Your love handles are thick rolls that reach around from your sides to your back, folding over your hips slightly along the way.   

Deciding you want to have a look at your fupa and thighs you lift up your belly, which is no easy task. You feel the muscles in your arm strain as you struggle to lift your massive gut up, revealing your thighs and fupa. You feel the cool air on your thighs and underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, or would be a nice pillow if your belly wasn’t there to suffocate anyone who might want to use it as such. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun. 

Unable to hold up your tubby gut any longer you let gravity have its victory, causing your belly to slap into your thighs with a loud, fleshy slap that sends your whole body jiggling. Turning your gaze to the part of your tights still visible you see how they struggle for space. They’re locked in a war for space, this is mostly caused by your rather average hips and your far above average girth. Your thighs force you to waddle wherever you go, which makes walking one of your least favorite tasks, especially considering that you also have to fight your belly for every step as it pushes down on your legs. 

  Turning around to have a look at your rear the first thing that catches your eyes is your fat back. Your back is thick with fat around your lower neck and shoulders, your shoulder blades have a roll that goes from the middle of your back and curves down towards your sides. Near the trough of the roll you see your love hands have a roll just below it. The roll from your love handles curves up from your hips and towards the center of your lower back. Just below these rolls you see your pudgy tail sticking out just above your ass. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Speaking of cake yours is rather lacking, looking down from your back and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.  
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.      

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

Your bosom is of a decent size compared to your girth. Your breasts rest on top of your apron of a gut, they stick out about half of the distance that your fat belly does. The bra your breasts fill is covered in grease and food stains, markings of prior feasts. Along with all of these stains you also have many sweat stains, these are mostly concentrated on your under-boob, armpits and on the fabric that your back rolls cover. The cavern of your cleavage isn’t much better. Deep in its depths grease-sweat covered crumbs have been buried, the tops on your breasts tell a similar story with crumbs, spots of sauce and grease littering their soft, squishy flesh. 

Below your bosom is your massive apron of a gut, really apron is too small of a turn, it&#39;s more like a great fleshy gate that seals away your royal fupa and aristocratic thighs. Your belly is one massive roll that is surprisingly perky given its size. Your belly button is a deep sweaty hole located somewhere on your gut, the location is of no value to you ever since you became unable to reach the front of your globular gut. Your belly sags down to your mid thigh, hiding everything underneath, creating a sweaty fold that rarely sees the light of day unless you&#39;re pawing desperately at your needy sex.

Due to your size, and laziness, you don’t bother or care to shave down there, after all you don’t expect any visitors any time soon, or ever, despite your yearning.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Taking a quick glance at the mirror you see your trim body, perfect horns and flawless  $player.color1 scales that seem to glow. You can’t help but smirk, most women would die to have a body like yours, even some other Dragon-folk women you’ve interacted with look at your body with a touch of envy and jealousy, especially once their mates started to eye you up. Deciding to more closely examine your beauty you take a step forward, after all, a Dragon-folk of your beauty has to be carefully studied, even if you&#39;re the one doing the studying. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your face is sharp, not an ounce of unwanted fat inhabits your face. Your lips are full, your cheekbones are high and quite prominent. The scales on your face are perfect and shiny, every one of them is perfectly shaped as well as vibrantly colored. Your impeccable face is framed by your perfect and grand horns that give you an air of authority; like a crown given to you by nature.

You let your eyes wander downwards, past your thin neck and narrow shoulders. They stop just at the starts of your cleavage. Your eyes wander along the edge of your cleavage, you run them down the curvature of your large bosom. You move your eyes away from your tantalizing cleavage and towards the rim of your bra. Your breasts have started to overflow your bra. Your bra tries in vain to keep your tits contained, however it fights a losing battle; only managing to keep the lower part and nipple of your breasts contained while the rest of your tit is free to jiggle around outside of the confines of the bra. 

Just below your large bosom is your tight and trim midsection. Your thin midsection makes your large and full bosom look even bigger, giving an illusion of massive breasts. While your upper body steals the limelight your lower body watches with envy from the shadows. 

Your hips are nothing more than slight bumps at your sides, they might as well be flat with how minimal their curves are. Below them are your thighs; while they are muscular they aren’t exactly the sexy thighs boys would drool over, instead they are purely functional. You turn slightly to look behind you at your flat ass. You can’t help but cringe, it&#39;s quite the disappointing rear, but, who cares? Everyone is too busy looking at your chest and face to care about your lackluster lower body. Though, the silhouette of your tail through dresses does often give the illusion of a larger rear, so really, your lack of ass isn’t too noticeable. You take a moment to also appreciate your thick and muscular tail as well your gradious wings.  
You smile, god you&#39;re good looking you murmur to yourself. You’ve always had a charm to you, plus your natural beauty, made it possible for you to always slip out of your studies as a child. I mean who needs to read when you can get anything you want with a wink and a smile, or if that doesn’t work threaten to turn them to ashes.

Looking at the mirror the first thing that catches your eye is your height. &lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Moving on from your height you focus on the finer details of yourself, starting with your face. The first thing you notice is your $player.color1 scales, which look dimmer than normal. Your face is thin, your eyes are sunken into your skull, every bone in your face is on full display though your thin, tight scaly-skin. Your cheekbones stick out sharply and your cheeks seem to dip inwards as the scaly-skin struggles to stretch over the bone. Your lips are thin, no more than two wispy red lines that mark where your mouth is. Your jawline is sharp and perfectly visible as there is no fat or really any muscle to cover it. 

Below your jawline is your disgustingly visible neck, you can make out every little muscle, tube, tendon and vein. Your shoulders are much in the same boat with you being able to see every single bone and dip that should be filled with either muscle or fat. Your eyes follow the rocky curve of your shoulder down to your thin arms. They resemble noodles, well, boney noodles with thin bits of muscle and tendons packed tightly against your bones all wrapped in tight skin. Your forearms follow this disgusting trend of being thin as well. Your hands are bony and thin, each finger is nothing more than bone and skin that seems to be animated by an unseen puppeteer.   

Looking at your chest you don’t know what you were expecting but it definitely wasn’t what you were seeing. Your chest is completely flat with your rips clearly visible and your collarbone seemingly sticking out. If you didn’t know any better you might mistake your chest for a very, very underweight boy&#39;s chest.

Your stomach is concave, it looks like your body is sucking it in, desperately trying to get any scrap of fat that might be left on it. Your rips out line it, creating a rounded upside down V shape over your concave stomach. 

Deciding that you already have a pretty good idea of what your lower body looks like you decide to stop looking at yourself, there&#39;s no point in causing yourself to be further disgusted.

Your forearms follow this disgusting trend of being thin as well. Your hands are bony and thin, each finger is nothing more than bone and skin that seems to be animated by an unseen puppeteer.   

Looking at your chest you don’t know what you were expecting but it definitely wasn’t what you were seeing. Your chest is completely flat with your rips clearly visible and your collarbone seemingly sticking out. If you didn’t know any better you might mistake your chest for a very, very underweight boy&#39;s chest.

Your stomach is concave, it looks like your body is sucking it in, desperately trying to get any scrap of fat that might be left on it. Your rips out line it, creating a rounded upside down V shape over your concave stomach. 

Deciding that you already have a pretty good idea of what your lower body looks like you decide to stop looking at yourself, there&#39;s no point in causing yourself to be further disgusted. 
(Note from Mr.C: Sorry for cutting off the description but writing for this weight started to make me ill.)

The first thing that catches your eye are your horns. They’ve always been eye-catching; they’re thick and tall, like a crown given to you by nature. Your horns are the only part of you, besides your chest. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, your  $player.color1 scales for the most part are clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most they&#39;re shiny and new looking. Your jawline and other features are well defined for the most part, nothing really extraordinary. You spend a few more moments inspecting your average face before turning your gaze elsewhere. 

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

Looking downwards at your chest you can’t help but crack a smile at the sight of your full bosom. Your breasts are large to say the least. Each one easily fills one of your hands. Your purple bra struggles to retain your bosom, breast fat oozes over the rim of your bra cups. Your cleavage is deep and due to how your breasts are squeezed into a bra that is a tad too small for them your cleavage is very well defined. 

Below your breasts is your plain midsection. It’s fairly flat as it only has enough padding to hide your ribs and make it soft to the touch. You have an average stomach overall, so, there isn’t much to really describe.  

Looking down you see your hips, they’re about as wide as they should be for a woman of your size and age. Much the same can be said about your thighs. Turning around to have a look at your ass you find that it&#39;s exactly what you expected it to be. It sticks out a bit, but not enough to be of any particularly notable size. Just above your simple ass is your tail, it’s fairly thick and the scales on it are vibrant and new looking, but for a Dragon-folkis of your age it&#39;s, well, average. Looking up at your back you see your wings, which, just like your tail are average so you don’t even bother giving them a once over.

Turning back to face the mirror you give yourself one last quick once over. Overall you&#39;re fairly average, you have a bit more top then most women, but you’re lacking in the rear compared to most women so it evens out. Though, you can’t help but smile thinking about your superior mental capabilities. 

&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
The first thing that catches your eyes is your $player.color2 hair. It’s always been eye-catching; it&#39;s smooth, shiny and pretty much flawless.

Your face is rather average, well, by elven standards, your $player.color1 skin for the most part is clear, a few blemishes here and there, but for the most it&#39;s clear.

The first thing that catches your eyes are your perky, cute little ears. They’re always the first thing that you spot and are one of the more unique aspects of your body, well, besides your chest. As your eyes drift downwards they quickly leave one of the only two parts of you that are exemplary in any way. Your face is rather average, your $player.color1 fur for the most part is clear, patchy or rougher spots here and there, but for the most it&#39;s vibrant and smooth.

&lt;&lt;switch $player.race&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case &quot;Dragon-folk&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing your eyes focus on is your face. Your face is attractive and somewhat sharp, the main thing that sticks out to you is your $player.color1 scales. You don’t take the greatest care of them, leaving some of them dull and there are a few spots where new scales have come in, making brighter spots, but it&#39;s not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty. Despiste your extra weight your face is still quite beautiful, with it sporting rounded cheeks, a soft jawline, a thick double chin and a pair of plump lips. 

Letting your eyes drift downwards they soon come to your soft shoulders that are layered in pudge, giving them a soft and squishy appearance. This layer of fat hides the musculature of your shoulders, not that you really have much to hide. Following the down curve of your shoulders you come to your upper arm, which, just like your shoulders, has a layer of fat obscuring your minuscule muscles and when holding your arms out the fab on them droops down slightly. Your forearms too follow this trend, your hands join in as well. Your hands lack any major details, besides your knuckles, and your fingers are fairly average looking, maybe a little on the plump side of things. 

Bringing your eyes back to your center they land on your massive breasts. Your breasts easily fill your double D bra and they are even over filling your bra quite a bit, leaving you with a deep canyon of cleavage and a chest that rips through the chests of most dresses. The soft flesh of your bosom overflows the confines of your bra, making them seem larger than they are. The tightness of your bra also creates an illusion of deeper cleavage than what you really have, plus your belly supporting your chest gives your chest an appearance similar to a corset. 

Speaking of your belly it’s fairly large, while it’s not large enough to eclipse your breasts, it is still large enough to serve as a good supporting self for your breasts. Your belly is made up from a single roll with it having a slight curve at the top, offering your breasts a soft shelf to rest on top of, before your belly curves down. Your belly has a fairly even distribution, though the bottom of your belly has a slight, if only due to gravity, extra bit of fat that sags down over your waist band.

Your hips are just about parallel with your love handles, though your hips might be just barely wider, but not by much. Your hips are rather lackluster to say the least. They struggle to fill dresses and are starting to lose the battle to your love handles in width. Your panties waistband is nuzzled between your hips and love handles, which helps keep it in place.  

Letting your eyes follow the slight curve of your hips downwards you see how they widen slightly before they taper down slightly to your thighs. Your thighs are fairly thick with them touching down to your mid thigh. They have an okay shape, with them being fairly blocky in shape. 

Turning around to have a look at your ass the first thing that sticks out to you is how flat it is. Your ass at its furthest point is just about parallel to your upper back, maybe it sticks out a little further. Your ass is covered in a nice helping of cellulite, giving it a cottage cheese like appearance. 

Just above your ass is your tail, it&#39;s decently thick and is about two feet in length. It tapers down as it approaches the tip of your tail, making it similar to a rudder on a ship when you’re flying.  

Above your tail, towards your upper back, is a nice pair of wings. Your wings have a slight layer of pudge at their base, but for the most part are fairly toned and muscular, allowing you to fly fairly well even with your increased weight. 

Turning back to look at yourself you take a moment to reflect on your body and yourself up to this point in your life. You enjoy eating quite a bit, probably more than you should, and it shows on your waist. You’d much rather sit down with a good book than you would go for a jog. This has led to you being on the more learned side, but your social skills have suffered a bit due to you preferring to read and subsequently be by yourself. You’ve also taken a liking to pleasuring yourself, nothing too major, just a good release of steam once or twice a night depending on your mood. Overall you’re a bit overweight and maybe a tad socially dull, but your intellect makes up for it and if all else fails you’ll be able to at least release some steam.  
&lt;&lt;case &quot;Elf&quot;&gt;&gt;
Focusing on your reflection in the mirror you decide to take a closer look at yourself. The first thing that catches your gaze is your &lt;&lt;print $player.color2&gt;&gt; hair. You’ve never really thought much about it, it’s always been fairly average. You’ve never really been hard pressed to take any extra care of your hair, leaving it in a very mediocre state. 

Below your mediocre hair is your soft face. Just like with your hair you’ve never really cared about having flawless skin, leaving your &lt;&lt;print $player.color1&gt;&gt; skin in a mediocre state with blemishes and acne scars here and there, but they&#39;re not prevalent enough to take away from your face&#39;s natural beauty.

&lt;&lt;include &quot;height&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing on your reflection the first thing that catches your eye is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Your $player.color1 scales are patchy in some areas, faded in others and shiny and new in others. This is a result of your rapid weight gain combined with your lack of self care. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Your eyes come to your soft shoulders, as your eyes move over their outline your eyes catch the deep dip in the soft flesh of your shoulder caused by your bra straps holding up their burden worthy of Atlas. Following the curve of your shoulder further down you eventually come to your flabby upper arm that hasn’t seen a hard day&#39;s work ever. You raise your arm out to your side, which really isn’t a super easy task. You watch as the fat flesh of your arm dangles down, giveing you a nice pair of fatty, embarrassing, useless wings. Reliving your weak muscles you let your arms down and move your gaze to inspect your forearms. Just like with your upper arms your forearms are covered in a thick layer of lard and lack any sort of muscles underneath. Your blueberry forearms taper down to your fat wrist, which is about as thick as a normal woman&#39;s forearm, which then leads to your pudgy, piggy hand. Your hands are nothing like the nimble, slender, dextrous penny-counter hands that one might expect from a future leader, instead they are the hands of an overfed pig, or maybe a bloated tyrant. Your fingers are round with fat, like sausages that have been overfilled, making them almost completely useless for anything other than stuffing yourself. 

Redirecting your gaze to your chest you see your massive bosom that could crush a weak table if you were to rest them down on the table too hard, or easily rip a normal bra to shards. Speaking of bras, your bra is absolutely gigantic, when you’re not wearing it you could easily mistake it for a childs dress or maybe a very petite womens dress. The fabric at one point was a vibrant purple but after months of abuse the color has faded to more of a dull purple that&#39;s covered in grease and sweat stains. The underboob and armpit areas of your bra are almost always visibly damp. The upper parts of the bra, including the rim, have been stained by grease and sauce stains from your many feasts. Your cleavage is deep, more than deep enough to bury a man&#39;s head, though with your lack of hygiene he might find it to be a greasy, crumb ridden cavaron of disgust, or bliss depending on if he&#39;s a freak or not. The tops of your breasts fare no better with crumbs, smudges of sauce or puddles of grease littering the surface of your massive calcium howitzers. 

Helping your bra in its atlantean task of holding up your breasts is your rather large belly whose sole purpose is to digest food and support your milk-silos. Your bell is one big flabby roll that for the most part is pretty perky, though at your size it does have a bit of sag to it, it is unavoidable after all. Due to the overhang of your breasts your belly for the most part escapes any crumbs or grease that might avoid your hungry maw, however it insead acts as a drip tray for any grease that your breasts fail to capture. Your belly button is a deep, damp hole that you often use to aid with self pleasure, especially considering that reaching your nethers is not exactly an easy task, along with reaching your own nipples. Your belly just barely covers your fupa, but other than that it leaves your lower body alone for the most part. 

Lifting up your belly and lifting it only a few inches is a task that requires a level of fitness you simply don’t have. Your muscles burn and scream as you struggle to lift it up a few inches, though you&#39;re almost lifting up your bosom in the process, which would explain the extra weight. You feel the cool air on your underbelly, you can see that your underwear is slightly damp with arousal. Your fupa is quite that fat roll that forms a nice pillow, too bad there&#39;s no one to use it. You’ve always had quite the libido, which has led to you almost always being damp at the least and soaking wet most of the time. The staining on your panties is partly from sweat and a lack of being washed regularly, but it&#39;s mostly due to your cum, which often soaks into your panties as you don’t bother to take them off to do it or take them off after you’ve finished having your fun.  

Letting your belly go, it flops down, hitting into your fupa, giving you an unexpected burst of pleasure. Regaining your senses, you look down at your thighs and see how thick they are, touching all the way down to just above your knees. You guess this makes sense as with how much weight is in your upper body you need a counter balance. The thickness of your thighs causes you to have a slight waddle as you struggle to get the thick, cellulite ridden tubes of lard to stubbornly slide past each other. Glancing up towards you see how your belly, or more specifically, your handles overhang your hips, hiding the waistband of your panties in its subsequent sweaty crevasse.

As your eyes follow your thick love handle you start to rotate your body, turning your back towards the mirror. Your back is a full blown bakery! On your upper back you see the strap of your bra dug in stubbornly into the rolls of your back; flesh oozing over and around it, trying to either pop it off or drown it. On your upper back as well, just about where your shoulder blades are, you have a pair of massive wings that are folded up. The base of the wings are covered in fat, which makes flapping them with any force quite difficult. Unfolding your wings you see how the thin membrane has gotten a bit thicker, which doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re fighting gravity every count. You give your wings a tentative flap, usually just a flap or two and you should be off the ground, or at least starting to leave the ground, instead you stay firmly fixed to the ground, it seems that you can’t fly, or would struggle to get off the ground. With that you fold your pudgy, useless wings up.Below your bra your love handles come together and arc upwards at the center of your back. Giving you two thick back rolls that stretch from your mid back down and round to your hips, flaring outwards in the process. 

A little above your ass is your fat tail. Your tail should be nimble and sleek, just like your wings however it’s thick with fat and lacking muscle. This leaves your tail practically useless as a rudder in the air, though it&#39;s not like you could even get your fat ass off the ground really. You try to move your tail around, it&#39;s heavy and mostly unresponsive, you struggle to move it around with any precision. Feeling the muscles start to burn you let it relax, it gently slaps into your ass, giving you a nice, almost pleasurable, sensasion from both the gentle slap on the ass and from your sensitive tail. A small smile graces your face as you think about how you could open a bakery with how many rolls you have, the only probably is your lack of cake, and what&#39;s a bakery without cake? 

Looking down from your tail and to your ass you see how relatively small it is. It isn’t flat, but it certainly isn’t going to be forming an ass shelf anytime soon, or ever. Your ass sticks out about as far as some of your back rolls, maybe slightly further. Even with a lacking ass your panties still manage to struggle to contain it, you can see how the fabric pushes into the soft flesh of your derriere. The fabric causes the area of fat under it to be pressed down in the shape of an upside down delta. As your eyes glance over the purple fabric one more time you notice a few small holes in the fabric, you can see your flesh oozing out of the holes, desperate to escape the compressing force of your panties. 

        Overall you’re a massively obese piggy who can’t help but stuff herself at every moment she can get. Along with this you’re an utter and complete slob that seems to enjoy it. You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color2 hair. You’ve never really taken the time to bother with your hair, whether it be washing it or combing it. You always took some pride in watching your parents squirm whenever they’d see it, you could always see the disdain in their eyes and you loved it. Taking care of your hair has always been too hard for you to bother to take care of it anyways, at least to you it feels too hard, after all you barely leave your room and you have little, to no, desire to appeal to anyone, especially your parents, you’ve decided that ship has sailed a long time ago, about 250 pounds ago to be precise.

Below your messy hair is your greasy, fat, slobby face. Just as with your hair you have done little to take care of your $player.color1 skin, leaving it looking greasy and blemished as well as being dotted with acne. This is something you take an odd pride in, considering that most elves have perfect, flawless skin, and here you are a disgusting slob; one of a kind. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump lips covered in crumbs and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.

&lt;&lt;if $slobOp isnot &quot;None&quot;&gt;&gt;Focusing on your reflection the first thing that catches your messy $player.color1 fur that coats your face and body. The fur around your mouth has been stained with grease and has crumbs in it, left overs from your last royal binge eating session. Your face is round and heavy with pudge. It sports fat cheeks, plump snout and a thick double chin that catches every drop of grease that your lips, and greedy tongue, fails to capture. Your jawline is soft and almost blends with your neck and double chin, at some spots it&#39;s indistinguishable.       

Looking down your eyes pass over your fatty neck that seems to almost melt into your soft shoulders. You let your eyes drift over the outline of your shoulders, as you do you spot the shoulder strap of your purple bra. The strap digs into the soft flesh of your shoulder, the poor bra you’ve been wearing has grown far too small for you and for one reason or another you haven’t gotten a bigger one. Letting your eyes drift further down your shoulder they eventually land on your arm. Your arms are nothing but fat, bone and a tiny amount of muscle. Lifting up your arms you see how the fat sags, giving you a pair of bingo wings. Letting your gaze travel further down wards you see how your forearms have the same flabby appearance as your upper arm. Your hands are fat, your fingers are thick with pudge, only good for shoveling food into your fat face.

You’re a shut-in who would rather eat and read than anything else, which has led to your social skills being rather lacking but you’re extremely educated on many things. Finally you’re also a horny slut who is desperate for attention but is too fat and lazy to do anything about it, instead opting for what little sensation you can provide to yourself.

Recently you’ve ballooned to a massive size, to say that you&#39;re simply obese would be putting it simply. To be frank obese doesn’t even begin to describe your corpulent form, from your flabby arms, hanging double belly and throne sized ass every inch of you is massive. 

Unfortunately you can’t exactly see all of your frame as you’ve officially expanded beyond what your mirror can contain. Looking at the mirror your belly and hips extend beyond the frame of the mirror. You’ve somehow managed to get so fat that a mirror can’t even display all of you. If you want to be able to see all of your rolls and every inch of your lard again you’ll need to get a bigger mirror.

Your $player.color2 hair as of recently has been looking worse and worse. It’s starting to get a bit messy and oily. This is probably the result of you not taking care of it.

  Your $player.color2 hair has only gotten worse as your neglect for it has grown along with your waist. You rarely blush it, let alone give it a good washing, so it has naturally gotten messy and oily. You’ve seen people look at you with disgust at your lack of hair care, but you don’t really care, after all, you&#39;re the queen and can do as you please.  
&lt;&lt;default&gt;&gt;
	Your $player.color2 hair is beyond messy, which is the result of never brushing it or taking care of it. You don’t really care how your hair looks, especially when you have more pressing matters to attend to like stuffing yourself.

After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?”  
&lt;&lt;include &quot;Chairbreak des&quot;&gt;&gt;
Barely a moment after hitting the floor you hear the sounds of boots running followed by Henry bursting through the door. Behind him is Wilson, both men pause as they see you on the floor, but they both relax a second later as they see what&#39;s left of the chair on the floor.
&lt;&lt;switch $chairbreak1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Henry is the first of you to recover, he quickly lowers himself to your side, his face worried. “M&#39;Lady, are you hurt? May I help you stand?” You feel him start to help you up before you respond, embarrassment filling you. 

“Oh, no, I’m fine Henry. I can get up on my own, thank you. Why don’t you two go back to standing guard? And Gabriela, why don’t you go have someone come up to clean this mess up?” You feel how red your face is, but you’ll be damned if you also embarrass yourself by letting him help you up or let Gabriela get any quick comments in. By sending them all away to do different tasks you should avoid any further embarrassment. 

Your three underlying all exchange glances. This time it’s Wilson who recovers first. “Well you all heard the Queen, get a move on.” Henry reluctantly stands, you have the feeling he really just wanted to touch you by helping you up, before he starts for the door. Gabriela stays in place, seemingly waiting for the two men to leave. Wilson however doesn’t give her the opportunity. “You hear her missy, get your fat ass out this door and get someone to clean this up. That is if you don’t want to feel the back of my hand across your face. Move!”

Wilsons threatening demeanor strikes you as something out of character for him. While a higher up hitting or beating a servant isn’t unheard of you wouldn’t expect it from a man like Wilson. You have the suspicious feeling that he just wanted to save you from the comments he knew she’d make. 

Gabriela raises an eyebrow at Wilsons threat, a smug smirk graces her face. “Of course, my overlord. I wouldn’t want another one of your vicious beatings that you&#39;re oh so famous for giving out.” She lets out a chuckle before putting a hand on her hip. “Really Wilson? That might work on the newer servants and the guardsmen, and poor Henry there, but I know you wouldn’t hurt a fly if you could help it.” She starts for the door, stopping in the doorway and turning to Wilson, looking at him over her shoulder. “You’ll have to try harder than that to frighten me.” With that she leaves the room, followed a few moments later by Henry. 

Wilson looks at the empty doorway for a moment before sighing. “Why must that woman be such a pain to deal with?” He turns and looks at you. “You know the trouble she causes for me? Good thing Henry scares easily. Well, I’ll leave you to it.” With that he leaves the room, shutting the door behind himself. 
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
Gabriela is the first to recover, she lets out a little chuckle before turning and looking at the two men. “Oh don’t worry boys, your prized queen pig is just fine. She’s just eaten a bit too much and broke her chair. You two should leave and save her the embarrassment.” The two guards look at you, seeing if you agree with her. Not wanting to embarrass yourself further you nod, letting the two men leave the room. Gabriela walks over and closes the door behind them before walking back over to you, standing over you.  &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;switch random(1,5)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
“Look at you. You’re so pathetic. I’m a big girl, but you&#39;re something else. You crushed that poor chair like it was nothing, and it&#39;s all because you can’t stop stuffing your fat face. You’re such a fat piggy, aren’t you?” She smirks as you feel yourself turn bright red. “Good girl, I love it when pigs are embarrassed when they realize what they’ve become. It never gets old for me. Now, while I’d love to stay and play with my piggy I have other things to do, like cleaning up this mess you made.” With that she walks to the door, opens it and leaves. You feel uncomfortably aroused by her words, you kind of like it.  &lt;&lt;set $player.arousal += 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
“That chair was really beautiful, too bad you just destroyed it. You’re like a pig who&#39;s managed to get into a castle. You crush furniture and clear out the pantry. Do you even feel any shame about how fat you’ve gotten? You should see what you look like. Your fat gut sags into your lap and your ass spreads out on the floor. If I was queen I’d keep you as a little pet to feed and fatten. Take you out on the town to show off.” She smiles and puts a finger to her lips thinking before putting her hands on her knees and bending down to be closer to you and in a low, commanding voice she speaks to you again. “But the best part would be using you as I please. I’d fatten you until you couldn’t move an inch. Don’t worry though, if you’re a good girl that might end up happening to you regardless.” She reaches down and gives you a pat. “Now, I have to go clean up this mess of yours. I trust you can get up on your own.” With that she walks to the door, opens it and leaves. You feel uncomfortably aroused by her words, you kind of like it.   &lt;&lt;set $player.arousal += 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;
“Look at this good piggy girl! You managed to crush a chair designed to hold your fat royal ass! Such a good girl…” You see her bite her lip as she looks you up and down. “You have so much promise. I can see you want to be a huge pig. A massive piggy.” She leans down and reaches out her hand, grabbing your belly and taking a good squeeze. “You&#39;re so soft and squishy, a little sweaty too. You’ll be perfect, but I have a feeling you’ll grow yourself, I have other piggies who need my help to reach their potential.” She lets go of your stomach, leaving you bright red and quite aroused. “Now, I have to go clean up this mess of yours. I trust you can get up on your own.” With that she walks to the door, opens it and leaves.&lt;&lt;set $player.arousal += 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;
“You like this don’t you? Being so massive you crush furniture under your massive ass? Being so fat you waddle and run out of breath. I bet you also like being talked to like your fat, worthless, piggy?” She leans down, placing her hands on her knees. She lowers her voice, letting it take on a commanding tone. “I bet you want me to be your master huh piggy? I’ll feed you, tie you up, make you cum and I’ll even wash you, maybe.” She chuckles. “I like a dirty pig.” She bites her lips and wiggles her hips a little. “Oh, thinking about what I’ll do to you and what you’ll become makes me so excited to get to work!” She lets out a sigh and stands back up. “Too bad though, maybe soon I’ll have the chance to play with my piggy queen. Now, I have to go clean up this mess of yours. I trust you can get up on your own.” With that she walks to the door, opens it and leaves. You feel uncomfortably aroused by her words, you kind of like it.  &lt;&lt;set $player.arousal += 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 5&gt;&gt;
“Oh, look at you! Such a fat pig!” She pushes her knees together and blushes, biting her lip. “I’m just too excited about seeing how massive you’re getting, I mean can you even control yourself? If you get too much bigger I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep my hands off you. I just want to pin you down and-” She puts her hand over her mouth and blushes while letting out a little chuckle. “Oh, I shouldn’t say too much, I want it to be a pleasant surprise for my pig.” She sighs and looks disappointed. “But I’m just so excited I can barely contain it! Don’t worry though, I have other piggy projects to work on before I move onto you as my main course. But that doesn&#39;t mean you can stop gaining, though I doubt you could fatty” She looks at you with hungry eyes, like a predator hunting her prey. “Oh well, enough teasing for now, someone has to clean up your mess.” With that she walks to the door, opens it and leaves. You feel uncomfortably aroused by her words, you kind of like it. &lt;&lt;set $player.arousal += 15&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $player.selfestem -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt; 
Now being left alone in your room you sit for a moment and reflect on the events that just transpired. After a few moments of thinking you decided it would now be a good time to get up off the floor. With quite a bit of effort you roll over onto your hands and knees. In this position you move over to the table a little more in order to use it to help you up. As you crawl to the table you can feel your belly drag across the floor. When did you get so fat?

Reaching the table you grab the edge of it and use it to help pull yourself to your feet. It takes a huge amount of effort but you just barely manage to pull yourself to your feet. You feel your face red with exertion and sweat gathering on your brow. You take a moment to catch your breath before turning and looking at the huge mess you made. That poor chair you think to yourself, it seems you won’t be eating for the moment. 

A few seconds later a servant tentatively enters the room with a broom and dustpan. They give you a curtsy bow before quickly and silently cleaning up the remains of your chair. They get very sharde of wood, every fractured plank and any other debris that have found they’re way from your chair. After only a few minutes they have the whole floor cleaned up and with that the unnamed servant leaves, leaving you alone to your own devices.

You go to reply but you’re cut off by the chair under your massive girth creaking and groaning. You feel the wood creak and shift. The sound of cracking and splintering wood suddenly fills the room as the joints of the chair finally start to give. Suddenly you feel the legs of the chair buckle as its ability to support you wanes. 

Gravity takes you fully bringing you down on the poor chair with full force. You let out a scream of surprises and you plummet down. What&#39;s left of the chair is crushed as your flabby ass lands on top of it. The sounds of wood breaking and snapping, along with your scream of surprise echo around the high quarters of the castle. 

You hit the ground with a thud, lucky for you all that fat on your body made you pretty protected. You can feel your body jiggle and wobble for a second as the shock moves through your fat body. You feel a slight pain in your ass from landing on it, but that&#39;s about it. Your chair however has suffered a gruesome death. You can feel a few pieces of wood under you with several others spread out around you.

The sound of cracking and splintering wood suddenly fills the room as the joints of the chair finally start to give. As the jointery starts to give you a feel the nails try desperately to keep everything together, however the wood simply cracks around them. The legs of the chair start to bow before the seat itself splits into several pieces around the nails meant to hold it together. 

Gravity takes you fully bringing you down on the poor chair with full force. You let out a scream of surprises and you plummet down. What&#39;s left of the chair is crushed as your flabby ass lands on top of it.

You feel a slight pain in your ass from landing on it, but that&#39;s about it. Thankfully you managed to not get any nails or splinters in your ass. Your chair however has suffered a gruesome death. You can feel a few pieces of wood under you with several others spread out around you. Bits of wood have been split in half by the nails meant to hold them together. The bronze nails lay scattered and bent on the floor around you, mixed in with the wooden debris of the chair. 
&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;
You go to reply but you’re cut off by the chair under your massive girth creaking and groaning. You feel the heavy oak of the chair start to shift, the wood struggling to cope with your weight. You can hear the iron fasteners groan and the oak wants to shift. Something you are going to give, but will it be the fasteners or the oak? Your answer comes less than ten seconds later as the nails and fasteners holding the seat of the chair gives. The sound of metal bending, wood splitting and nails begging for the sweet release of death fills the room. 

With a final loud snap you feel the cushioned seat break off from the heavy set legs of the chair. Gravity, like the fiend it is, seize this opportunity to grab you in its clutches and sends you pumiting to the ground. The heavy legs of the chair no longer supporting the seat topple over, lucky they all fall outwards, away from you. 

You hit the floor with a loud thud and a scream of surprise, followed by the four heavy legs hitting the floor. Lucky for you the cushioned seat of the chair held up under you and your fat filled body protected you from the impact. You feel every inch of your body jiggle and wobble for several seconds before finally coming to a rest. Spread out around are bent pieces of iron and nails, splinters of wood and the four large legs of the legs of the chair. Bent and broken nails stick out of them from where they connected to the seat.  
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;
You go to reply but you’re cut off by the chair under your massive girth creaking and groaning. You feel the oak of the chair trying to separate at the joint, desperate to relieve itself of the massive forces it&#39;s being placed under. The iron at the joint however keeps the pieces of wood firmly in place however. 

Unable to reduce or escape the stresses being placed on it, the oak of your chair starts to break down. It splits where nails hold it together, crack where iron fasteners hold it in palace and splinters as it crumbles. The legs of the chair bow outwards before suddenly and violently snapping. The arms of the chair snap off, the back snaps in half and the seat under your ass breaks in several places. 

You hit the floor with a loud thud and a scream of surprise. Lucky for you the cushioned seat of the chair, mostly, held up under you and your lard filled body protected you from the impact. You feel every inch of your body jiggle and wobble for several seconds before finally coming to a rest. Spread out around are bent pieces of iron and nails, splinters of wood and the four large legs lay in pieces around you. Their splinter and shards of wood litter the floor from how violently they exploded when your fat ass crushed them.  
&lt;&lt;case 5&gt;&gt;
You go to reply but you’re cut off by the chair under your massive girth creaking and groaning. You feel the iron wood start to give under you incredibly massive weight. How you can even hold your own weight surprises you, so this poor chair stood no chance in your mind. You feel the seat bowing, the legs struggling and the joints scream in pain and agony. Why would you punish this poor chair like this? 

The chair isn’t able to stand up to your weight for very long as it completely disintegrates in a matter of seconds. The seat had a limit to how far it could bed before shattering, and it reached it. The six legs of your chair were in a similar position, they bowed a little too much, well, way too much and they shattered. The arms and back of your chair in the ensuing destruction didn’t fare any better, the force put on the rest of the chair caused their joints to bend violently, resulting in cracks and splinters in the poor wood.

Gravity took your almost 1,000 pound body like how you grab a sweet roll; blindingly fast that is. You hit the floor with a thud that shook the whole room, you even felt the floor under your bow with your weight. You probably just scared anyone on the floor below you half to death. Luckily for you weight has put a ton of padding on your fame, protecting you from any injury. The chair however lays in smithereens, you can’t even tell what it was. It looked as if it had exploded. Nails, iron and wood litter the floor of the room, it looks like a disaster zone.  &lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="Gabsnack" tags="" position="1700,2200" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;switch $choice&gt;&gt;

“I think today I’ll just be having a snack. Some cheese, bread and dried meats should do fine.” 

“Just a snack? Surely you’d like something a bit more filling? And tasty to add!” Gabriela smiles encouragingly at you, clearly she wants you to have something more than just a snack. “I’ll go ahead and have the kitchen make something more for you, My Lady.”

Gabriela’s gone for a few minutes before returning, she places the tray of cheeses, bread and dried meats on the table. “Enjoy.” She says evenly, no hint of actual emotion in her voice. With that she leaves the room, leaving you to enjoy your meager meal. 

You quickly eat your little meal, which barely fills you up. Maybe you should have taken her offer to have more. Oh well, you can always order more food you guess.

Gabriela’s smile widens and she nods her head, clearly pleased you accepted the larger meal. “Of course, My lady. A Queen does deserve a larger meal than a snack.” She turns and walks out of the room, as she leaves you can’t help but notice how her wide hips sway with every step, and how the fat of her ass and back ripple as she walks. 

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-chibi-exit-rear.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

Gabriela’s gone for a few minutes before returning, she places a tray with fried duck, seared vegetables and soup before you. She then places down a second tray that has a very delicious looking sweet roll on it. It’s topped with powdered sugar with a drizzle of what looks like honey. Everything before you looks declicus, though maybe a little more than what you thought she’d get you when you asked for a little more. “Enjoy, you deserve it.” She gives you a devilish smile, you wonder if she maybe did something to your food. With that she leaves the room, though she lingers at the door for a moment, watching you, before leaving.

The thought of her poisoning your food is quickly dismissed by the hunger in your stomach. You quickly dig into the meal placed before you. You bite into the crunchy fried duck, the flavor hitting your tongue is incredibly tasty, you also notice that the fried duck is incredibly greasy. The seared vegetables too are delicious, though they taste oddly greasy and sweet. The soup is good, but nothing compared to the duck and vegetables. 

Next you dig into the sweet roll. You try to eat it as clearly as possible, but inevitably some honey drips onto your cleavage and some powdered sugar sticks to your lips. Each bite of the delicious desert is heavy and rich. Pared with the powdered sugar and honey it&#39;s absolutely divine. After eating it you feel oddly full from it. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 5&gt;&gt;You let out a little burp before licking your lips clean and using your finger to get the honey off your tits and into your mouth. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You grab a napkin and wipe off your lips and clevage.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; With that your meal is now over, what would you like to do?

Now fully decided what you want to have to eat you wait for the servant you summoned to make their way up to your room. After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?” 

“I think today I’ll just be having a snack. Surprise me, but nothing too heavy” 

Gabriela smiles and nods her head before turning and making her way to the door. As she leaves you can’t help but notice how her wide hips sway with every step, and how the fat of her ass and back ripple as she walks. 

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-chibi-exit-rear.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

Gabriela’s gone for a few minutes before returning, she places two huge trays down on the table before you. One has a massive rack of ribs, smothered in a deciduous looking crimson sauce that has partially caramelized to the meat. The rack of ribs takes up one of the trays, leaving no room for anything else. On the other tray is a bowl of mashed potatoes, covered in gravy. Next to the mashed potatoes are freshly baked cornbread with honey drizzled over them. The last item on the tray is a chocolate pie. 

You look at Gabriela and raise an eyebrow. She looks at you, a look of forced confusion comes over her face. “Is something wrong, My Lady? I think I got the rack and made sure to get enough food to make it a heavy meal.”

“I said a snack and nothing too heavy.” You can tell that she’s clearly pretending to be confused, at least you think she is. Maybe she genuinely thought this is what you asked for. Snack kind of sounds like rack.

“Oh! Silly me. My hearing is just soooo bad you know?” She gives you a smug smile. “Oh well, it&#39;s already made and it would be such a shame to waste it, right My Lady?”

Her smile remains unfazed. “Of course, I’ll be sure to get rid of whatever you don’t eat. Just take what you want and put it on this tray and I’ll get rid of everything else.” She takes the pie, mashed potatoes and cornbread off one of the trays and moves it closer to you. “What would you like, My Lady?” 

“Give me a few ribs, some cornbread, a helping of mashed potatoes and a slice of pie please.” You’re a little surprised by how much you asked for, but you suppose you are pretty hungry, probably. As instructed she adds the requested amount of food to your tray and piles everything else onto the other tray with the rest of the ribs and leaves you to enjoy your meal. 
The smell of the hot food fills your nose, you feel your mouth water and your stomach rumbles. You want to eat it all so badly. You grab one of the sauce covered ribs and take a bite of it. The juicy meat falls off the bone and almost seems to melt in your mouth. The sauce is sweet and tangly, feeding your desire for more. You quickly devour the other rips you have, next you move onto the gravy covered mashed potatoes. You shovel them into your mouth as fast as your hand can move the spoon. The mashed potatoes have a garlic-salty flavor that pairs perfectly with the thick, savory taste of the warm gravy. Before you know it the pile of potatoes is gone, leaving only the cornbread and pie. You grab a piece of the cornbread and shove it into your mouth. The dese bread and the sweet honey go great together. With a heavy swallow the flavor is gone but quickly regained as you shove another piece of bread into your maw, followed by another. With the cornbread consumed you move onto the single slice of chocolate pie. Fork in hand you quickly devour the dark, rich chocolate and salty crust of the pie. The pie disappears between your ravenous lips. 

The tray before now lays empty, other than a few crumbs, dips of sauce and drops of honey. You feel quite full after your eating frenzy. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 5&gt;&gt; Your lips are covered in crumbs and honey, you use your tongue to lick them clean.

You let out a burp and give your belly a little pat, which leads to a second, quieter, burp to escape your lips. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You can feel that your face, fingers and cleavage are covered in crumbs. You grab a napkin and start to wipe off your sauce covered fingers, your crumb and honey coated mouth and your chocolate crumb covered cleavage. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“What does my lady wish to eat today?”

“Hmm, I’m thinking I want something very filling and heavy today. I think maybe some pork chops, cornbread with honey and butter, some fried chicken and pumpkin pie for dessert.” 

Gabriela nods her head eagerly as you list off what you want. “Anything else for you today, My Lady? I mean if you’re going to eat like the pig you are you might as well go all out. Why don&#39;t you get a cake too? Or maybe a roast? Rack of ribs? Or maybe everything?” Clearly Gabriela thinks you should have a bit more. Maybe you should?

   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabriela’s smile fades a little as you turn down her offer for more food. “Well if you&#39;re sure you want just that. If you’re worried about what it’ll do to your waist I think now&#39;s a little late to worry about that, My Lady.” She says as she reaches down and pats your belly. She is right, you are a little on the portly side to be worrying about your waistline. Though, it’s never too late to lose weight… or maybe it is. “Well I better go get that food for you, your royal lardyness.” 

With that Gabriela makes her way to the doorway. You look down at your stomach and you can’t help but wonder how much of your weight gain is due to her? She’s always trying to give you more food, make you fatter. But she also teases you, makes fun of you and humiliates you. You’re not totally sure if you dislike it too, sometimes you find yourself a little aroused by it even. 

You get lost in your thoughts for several minutes when you’re suddenly snapped out of it by Gabriela entering the room. She has a small cart with her, she wheels it over to the table and starts to unload the little cart. On the cart there are four dishes and they are exactly what you asked for. A huge plate of pork chops, a tray of corn bread covered in a very fattening layer of honey, a plate of greasy fried chicken and a big pumpkin pie, all for you.  

The smell of all the food compels you to devour the food. You first set about taking on the pork chops first. Of course because you’re queen they come pre sliced up for you, so no need for a knife. Grabbing a fork you pick up one of the slices before putting it into your mouth. Usually pork chops are dry and have a tougher texture to them, but these pork chops are greasy and seem to melt in your mouth. They taste sweet, they probably have a honey glaze on them which only adds to the feeling of them melting in your mouth. Every slice of meat is quickly devoured and you move onto your cornbread. You grab a piece of cornbread covered in honey and shove it into your mouth. The bread dries out your mouth but the honey melts in your mouth, balancing the drying out. You spend no time shoving more pieces of cornbread into your mouth, quickly eating them all. You grab one of the still hot chicken breasts and shove it into your hungry maw. You bite into it with a satisfying crunch, the oil and grease from the chicken pour into your mouth. You quickly show the rest of the fried chicken breasts into your mouth, clearing the plate in minutes. Finally you move onto the gem of your meal; the pumpkin pie. With a great haste that can only be inflicted by hunger you dig into the pie. The soft texture of the bit and the crunchy crust fills your mouth. The cinnamon flavor and sweetness takes over causing your mouth to salivate and you to eat even faster. Before you know it the huge pie is gone. You already miss it as the last bite travels down your throat. 

With your feast now consumed and stuffed into your poor gut you lean back in your chair. You can feel food all over your face and cleavage. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 6&gt;&gt; You move your tongue around as best as you can in order to get every crumb and morsel of goodness that might be on your face. Next you lick off every one of your fingers, making sure to get off all the crease and food. Finally you struggle to clean off your breasts, you try with your hands to help you but there&#39;s only so much you can do. With your body now mostly clean you lean back to tend to your over filled belly. You start gently rubbing to release some of the pressure in your gut. You burp loudly several times before settling into releasing a steady number of little burps.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You grab a napkin and start to wipe off your fingers and hands. Next you wipe off your disgusting face before moving onto your cleavage, trying your best to clean it off. With your body now cleaned off you lean back in your chair to tend to your over filled belly. You start to rub it, you feel the food sloshing around as you rub, it feel oddly good and it makes you feels less overfilled. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Gabriela’s smile widens as she hears that you want to have more food. “That&#39;s wonderful, I think I’ll get you a cake, a rack of ribs, and a roast.” She nods to herself happily. “Yes, I think that will work fine.” She leans over you, reaching one arm down to pat your belly. “I hope you&#39;re hungry, My lady.” She stands up and removes her hand from your belly. “Well I better go get that food for you, your royal lardyness.” 

With that Gabriela makes her way to the doorway. You look down at your stomach and you can’t help but wonder how much of your weight gain is due to her?

A huge plate of pork chops, a tray of corn bread covered in a very fattening layer of honey, a plate of greasy fried chicken, a rack of ribs, a roast, a large chocolate cake and a big pumpkin pie, all for you. 

The smell of all the food compels you to devour the food. You first set about taking on the pork chops first. Of course because you’re queen they come pre sliced up for you, so no need for a knife. Grabbing a fork you pick up one of the slices before putting it into your mouth.

You bite into it with a satisfying crunch, the oil and grease from the chicken pour into your mouth. You quickly show the rest of the fried chicken breasts into your mouth, clearing the plate in minutes. You already feel so full, especially after the cornbread, but you&#39;re no quitter! Grabbing the rack of ribs you waste no time ripping off each rib and practically inhaling the meat off the bones. The sweet and tangy flavor goes well with the juicy tender meat of the ribs. It takes very little effort to get all the meat of the bones, which allows you to inhale the whole rack of ribs in just a few minutes. While you feel your belly stretching you know you have to have more. You seize the roast, ripping it apart with your bare hands. The hot juice and grease from the tender roast covers your hands, and your face as you stuff every bit of food into your maw. Every handful causes drips of grease to land in your cleavage. With one final mouthful you fish the roast.

Your next opponent though will not so easily be devoured. Before you is a huge chocolate cake, it&#39;s even two tiers! How did Gabriela even get this put together so quickly? Does she have a stock or does the kitchen keep a stock made for you? How wasn’t any of this food made so quickly? You shake your head, the evil chocolate cake is clearly filling your head with this flood of logical folly. You pull the huge cake to the edge of the table. Your hands and face are already covered in food so why bother with a fork, besides, you need to end this food fight quickly before your food coma sets in. You grab handfuls of the cake and shove it into your face. The sweet rich chocolate taste fills your mouth, drying it out, slowing down how quickly you can eat. Yet another dastardly ploy from this evil chocolate cake. As you continue to push through the cake you ignore how dry your mouth is, finally you reach the innards of the cake. Here the cake has a chocolate filling that helps to rehydrate your mouth. Your battle rages on with the cake, but finally you manage to win. Both cake and victory are sweet. You take a moment to reflect and decide maybe you should stop personifying your food… 

 Finally you move onto the gem of your meal; the pumpkin pie. With a great haste that can only be inflicted by hunger you dig into the pie. The soft texture of the bit and the crunchy crust fills your mouth. The cinnamon flavor and sweetness takes over causing your mouth to salivate and you to eat even faster.

Finally you struggle to clean off your breasts, you try with your hands to help you but there&#39;s only so much you can do. With your body now mostly clean you lean back to tend to your over filled belly. You start gently rubbing to release some of the pressure in your gut. You burp loudly several times before settling into releasing a steady number of little burps.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You grab a napkin and start to wipe off your fingers and hands. Next you wipe off your disgusting face before moving onto your cleavage, trying your best to clean it off. With your body now cleaned off you lean back in your chair to tend to your over filled belly. You start to rub it, you feel the food sloshing around as you rub, it feels oddly good and it makes you feel less overfilled. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;case 0&gt;&gt;
Now fully decided what you want to have to eat you wait for the servant you summoned to make their way up to your room. After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?”

“Hmm I want something heavy, something very filling. Oh, and something with dessert. Surprise me.” 

Gabriela’s smile widens. “Something heavy? How about I just get you dessert? A chocolate cake, cheesecake, some pies and maybe another chocolate cake, cheesecake and a few more pies for good measure. Does that sound good to piggy?” She doesn’t wait for your answer before clasping her hands together and smiling. “Excellent, I’ll go get that right away for piggy.”

With that Gabrial makes her way to the door and leaves quickly to get your feast of desserts. Without anything to do or anyone to talk to you look down at your lap, well, it&#39;s more of your belly these days. You think for a moment thinking about how much weight you’ve been gaining recently. Has it been because of Gabriela? Or are you really just that much of a fat pig? Honestly, you don’t know if you’re even upset if that is the case. You rather like being fat, and getting fatter and eating more. 

Your thoughts are disrupted when Gabriela reenters the room with a cart full of cakes and pies. It seems you’ve been lost in thought for a few minutes. Gabriela puts the cart next to the table and quickly unloads all of the pies and cakes onto the table. She looks at the food and then looks at you before nodding. “Quite the little fattening feast, wouldn’t you say? Well, I’ll leave you to it.” Just as quickly as she entered she leaves, leaving you with all the cakes and pies. 

&lt;div class=&quot;box-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;boxsmall&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;nameplate&quot;&gt;Actions&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;right-text&quot;&gt; &lt;&lt;link [[Eh, might as well eat it all |Gabheavymealwithdessert]]&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $choice to 2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $eatalone to 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;      
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
   Deciding you don’t want to completely make a pig of yourself you only are going to have a little. Though the definition of a little bit is left up for debate. Looking at the arrangement of two chocolate cakes, two cheesecakes and a variety of pies, you decide that a little bit of food would be a reasonable amount of food, which is one chocolate cake, one cheese cake and a few pies. A totally reasonable amount of food for someone who only wants to eat a little bit. 

Looking at the decadent desserts before you, you decide to dig into the chocolate cake first. You slide the massive double tiered cake towards you, which isn’t an easy task considering the size of the cake and the cakes surprising heft. You’re honestly surprised that Gabriela was able to unload it onto the table. Finally you manage to get the cake close enough to actually start devouring the thing, though now that it&#39;s so close you’re starting to wonder if you could even eat all of it. The top of the cake sits about level with your eye line, making it look incredibly imposing. Tentatively you pick up your fork and take a chunk of cake off. The cake is dense, you can feel the weight of it on the fork as you bring it to your mouth. You bring the cake laden fork to your mouth, pushing towards your lips. The cake is dense and moist, the rich chocolate flavor fills your mouth making you salivate for more. The moist cake helps to keep your mouth from drying out as you devour the chunk of cake in your mouth. As you swallow the hunk of cake you feel yourself growing hungry for more of the cake. You shovel a few more chunks of cake into your mouth with your fork before discarding it as it simply can’t keep up with the pace of you eating. Now using your hands you’re able to consume the cake at an unprecedented speed, though the trade off is that crumbs of cake are getting everywhere, all over your hands and face and, naturally, your cleavage and gut. You don’t even care how dirty you’re getting, all you care about is shoving more fattening cake into your bottomless maw. You quickly find that the top tier of the cake, once standing tall, is nothing more than a few crumbs on top of the now single tier cake. With the top tier gone and eaten you move onto the bottom tier of the cake. The bottom tier of the cake is wider and thicker than the top tier. While eating the top tier of the cake was a breeze, the bottom will not be so easy. 

Sliding the bottom closer to you, you start to shovel handfuls of cake into your face. You’re eating like you haven’t eaten in months but the truth is you’re just a fat pig who can’t stop stuffing her own face. Every chocolaty bite is bliss on an indescribable level, it makes you want more, much more. The feeling of your stomach expanding with every bite of cake feels wonderful as you feel it pack into your stomach. The bottom tier of the cake is even more dense than the top tier, probably because it would have to hold up the top of the cake without collapsing into itself. Truly it&#39;s a masterpiece of a confectioner&#39;s work, a true work of art and engineering. Too bad that the cake is quickly being devoured and almost as quickly turned into more lard to fill your body. Every bite of the tasty cake adds more and more pressure to your quickly filling stomach, truth be told you have no idea how you’ve been able to fit so much cake into your stomach so far. After a few more minutes of messy eating you finally manage to finish off the bottom tier, leaving it as a pile of crumbs and chocolate smears. 

With the cake now being just a few crumbs and smears on the platter you push it to one side, the first dessert now devoured. Not wanting to wait for a moment you pull the cheesecake towards yourself. The cheesecake, while physically smaller than the chocolate cake, is quite a bit heavier, this is probably due to cheesecakes being considerably denser than regular cake. This time you skip using a fork and move right onto using your hands, taking handfuls of cheesecake and shoving them into your hungry maw. The cheesecake is dense and cool, the creamy smooth texture fills your mouth as you quickly chew it before swallowing it and moving onto your next mouthful. If your stomach wasn’t getting full with the chocolate cake it certainly is now with the much denser cheesecake. With every bite you feel your stomach growing heavier and more laden with food. Despite your overfilled gut you press on, determined to get every tasty bite into your maw. You feel your gut getting tighter as you approach your limit, but you press on, desperate to get every ounce of cake into your fat belly. After several more handfuls the cheesecake is gone, reduced to nothing but a few crumbs of crust and filling that dot that plate, and you. 

Leaning back in your chair you rub your cake covered hand on your belly, smearing cake all over it as you rub. A few burps come out of you as you free up some more room for pie that still has yet to even be touched. You continue to rub your poor belly for a few more minutes, of course a few, well more than a few, burps escape your plump lips. With a bit more room made in your stomach you decide to get back to eating. 

Grabbing one of the many pies that litter the table you bring it close. With no easy way to eat the pie you decide to just eat it face first. You bring the pie close to your face and start to dig in. Your tongue works over time to shovel food into your mouth. You barely even taste the apple pie as you devour it. You make quick work of it, even licking the pie tin clean before setting it aside and moving onto the next pie. Your face was already covered in cake but now it’s covered in even more goodies. Grabbing another pie you repeat the process of  eating it, shoving it into your face and eating it like a pig eating out of a trough. You just can’t stop yourself from eating like this, your only concern is getting as much food into your face as physically possible. This pie is key lime, but you hardly taste it as you clean out the pie tin, the only thing left of the pie are the little bits of it left on your face. While you still have four more pies left you decide to stop eating now. Your belly feels like it might explode and you have food all over yourself.

You lean back in your chair for a moment. You can feel there is a caked on layer of food on your face. You feel like an absolute pig, you probably look like one too. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gte 6&gt;&gt;Deciding to clean yourself up a little you use your tongue to lick off as much cake and pie off your face as you can. It turns off there is quite a bit and whatever you can reach with your tongue you use your dirty hands to help with. Speaking of dirty hands you notice just how much cake and pie has stuck to them. Your fingers and palms are covered in a layer of tasty desserts that are just calling your name. You waste no time licking them clean, their flavors melding together into a taste that can only be described as fattening. Finally you move only cleaning off your cleavage and belly as best you can. By cleaning you mostly mean wiping off any frosting or crumbs and then eating them. Overall you mostly clean yourself up, at least compared to what you looked like a minute ago.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Deciding to clean yourself off you grab a napkin and start to wipe off your hands. You end up using quite a few on your hands alone due to the sheer amount of food on them. Maybe you shouldn’t eat with your hands like this. Next you move onto your face, which is a little difficult to see what you’re doing without the aid of a mirror but you think you manage to clean up pretty well anyways. Finally you start to clean up your cleavage and belly. You’re surprised at just how much you got on your breasts and belly. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Eventually someone comes and clears off the remaining food and leaves you to do as you please.

   &lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
   Deciding to just eat everything you decide to first start with one of the massive chocolate cakes. Next you’ll probably move onto the cheesecakes and then the many pies. Gowsh, so much to eat and so little time. You’ll probably end up so messy and absolutely stuffed by the time you’re finished. 

Looking at the decadent desserts before you, you decide to dig into the chocolate cake first. You slide the massive double tiered cake towards you, which isn’t an easy task considering the size of the cake and the cakes surprising heft.

After a few more minutes of messy eating you finally manage to finish off the bottom tier, leaving it as a pile of crumbs and chocolate smears.

With the first of the two chocolate downs reduced to crumbs you feel a little more confident in your abilities to consume both of the huge cakes, but the growing fullness in your stomach quickly pokes holes in the confidence. Nevertheless you pull the next cake close to you and begin the same process of devouring it. Bite after bite of delicious cake fills your stomach, making you fuller and most definitely fatter, or at least bloated for now. After several grueling minutes, or at least that&#39;s what it feels like, you’ve kinda lost track of time, the second huge cake has been devoured and stuffed into your overfilled belly.  

With the cakes now being just a few crumbs and smears on the platters you push them to one side, the first desserts now devoured. Not wanting to wait for a moment you pull the cheesecake towards yourself. The cheesecake, while physically smaller than the chocolate cake, is quite a bit heavier, this is probably due to cheesecakes being considerably denser than regular cake.

After several more handfuls the cheesecake is gone, reduced to nothing but a few crumbs of crust and filling that dot that plate, and you. With the first cheesecake down you move onto the second. Every bite is both painful and bliss as your stomach expands with everybite. You want more so badly, yet it hurts so much but that feels so good. It’s a paradox, but in your hazy hunger you’re too focused on the food to care about any paradoxes. Before you’re even really aware of it the whole cheese cake is gone, leaving just the pies. 

Leaning back in your chair you rub your cake covered hand on your belly, smearing cake all over it as you rub. A few burps come out of you as you free up some more room for pie that still has yet to even be touched. You continue to rub your poor belly for a few more minutes, of course a few, well more than a few, burps escape your plump lips.

The next several pies go by in a blur, you honestly have no idea what flavors they were. One might have been a pumpkin pie, but honestly all of it is gone now and there&#39;s no trace left of the pies to even tell.

Now fully decided what you want to have to eat you wait for the servant you summoned to make their way up to your room. After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?”

“I think I want a feast prepared for me. I think a cart full of meat and other tasty things, and then a cart of deserts will be sufficient for me.”

Gabriela nods her head a few times before giving you a quizzical look. “That&#39;s it? Anything else? Don’t you want maybe some other items? Maybe a third or fourth cart of food? I mean just two carts isn’t much of a feast, especially one meant to feed one as corpulent as you.”

		&lt;/div&gt;      
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabriela nods. “Of course, just two carts for the queen pig. I’m sure you’ll get to four someday.” Before she walks away she leans down and takes a handful of your belly and shakes it. She studies how your belly wobbles and jiggles for a second before looking at you and smiling. “I think most of this is new. I’m not sure whether to call you a good piggy or a naughty piggy for getting so fat.” She leans back, standing up right.  

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-look.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

She places her right hand on her hip, letting her left hand hang passively. “You really should be careful, I’d hate for you to break even more furniture. It’s expensive to replace and that money is better invested in more edible assets in my humble opinion.” She gives you a little smile before turning and walking out of the door, leaving you alone in your room waiting somewhat patiently for your feast. 

Several minutes later you hear the sounds of metal wheels and footsteps growing closer. The sounds grow closer before finally reaching your door. Turning you see Gabriel open the door, holding it open as two servants bring in the carts, leaving them next to your table before they leave. Gabriela walks over to you, her gazing wandering over the vast assortment of food loaded onto the carts. “I don’t think that all of this is going to fit onto the table. Hmm.” She thinks for a moment, putting her hand on her chin. “I know, I’ll just slide the table away from you and put the carts right in front of you.” 

She walks over, grabbing the edge of the wooden table and with a bit of effort moves it away from you, making just enough room to slide one cart in front of you. She moves the other cart along the side of your chair, allowing you to reach every item placed on the carts. “Alright, looks like you can reach everything. Enjoy piggy, and just ring the belly when you’re done and someone will come and clean up the mess you’ll inevitably make.” With that Gabriela exits your room, leaving you by yourself with the feast to devour. 

The sheer amount of food before you is simply overwhelming to say the least. The variety alone is awetaking but the amount of it is intimidating to say the least. You recognize a few dishes, ribs, beef roast, pork chops, fried chicken, duck, mashed potatoes with gravy, cheesy carrots, cornbread and honey, dinner rolls, stew, soup, lamb chops, buttery corn, pork tenderloin, and several other dishes. That&#39;s the contents on one cart. The dessert cart has a similar variety with it containing cheesecake, chocolate cake, donuts, eclairs, chocolate covered croissants, angel cake, fruit cake, pudding, and a few other desserts.     

The feeling of being overwhelmed quickly fades and hunger sets in. You feel your mouth start to drool and your stomach rumble thinking about eating everything in front of you. You feel your lust for food growing stronger and stronger. You grab a handful of fried chicken and shove it into your maw, the grease and crumbs getting all over your face. The fried chicken is wonderful and only adds fuel to the fire. You alternate between foods, grabbing handfuls of food and shoving it into your mouth like a feral animal. Quickly every dish starts to evaporate as you make your way through every dish. You grab the bowl of mashed potatoes and dump gravy all over them before shoveling the hot creamy, and slightly salty, potatoes drenched in savory gravy into your mouth. The bowl quickly empties and you lick your fingers clean before moving onto the honey covered cornbread and juicy pork tenderloin, the two items counteracting each other keeping your mouth fairly wet. Next, feeling a little thirsty you move onto the soup. Bringing the bowl to your lips, you drink the soup in one go. Before you even have time to process what you’re doing you dive into the stew and dinner rolls. Shoving a whole roll in your mouth before taking a large swig of stew like it was water.  

With the first cart&#39;s food beginning to dwindle you become aware of the growing fullness in your gut. You can feel how bloated and stuffed you&#39;re getting. Looking down you can see that your stomach is visibly stretched out slightly from how much food you’ve eaten. You also notice how much food is on you. You’re covered in drops of grease and soup, coated in crumbs and little bits of meat and your face is slathered in food. Honestly though, you like how it feels to be a dirty pig.

Digging back into your feast you waste no time in polishing off the last remaining morsels of food that are left on the first cart. Not stopping for a break you shift your attention to the dessert cart. You stuff your face with handfuls of dense cheesecake, rich chocolate cake, sugarly donuts, creamy eclairs, tasty croissants, thich pudding and much more. You honestly start to lose yourself as the growing fullness in your belly increases and you feel your mind get foggy. You feel yourself fall into a haze of eating, burping and eating. You don’t stop for breaks, you only eat. Handful after handful you feel your belly become painfully full. You can’t stop yourself, you’re not really even aware of what&#39;s happening. Every bite is worth the pain in your belly, though you rather like the pain of fullness.  

You eventually regain your senses and find that the cart has been picked clean. Your hands have been seeming licked clean and most of the food has been removed from your breasts and face. At least in your haze you made sure to clean them, though you probably just knew what was on them. You’re slouched back in your chair, you go to sit up but the fullness in your gut prevents you from doing so. With a burp and a groan you lean back in your chair and rest for a few moments. After a while you feel your stomach has digested enough to allow you to move again. You reach over and ring the bell, letting the castle servants know that you’re done with your feast. A few minutes later a servant comes and takes away the carts as well as giving the floor a quick sweep and putting the table back where it originally was. Looking down you can’t help but notice how the gap between the table and your gut seems to have closed. The servant must have pushed the table closer than it originally was… probably.

&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
Gabriela nods. “Of course, four carts for the queen fat ass. I’m sure you’ll get to eight someday.” Before she walks away she leans down and takes a handful of your belly and shakes it. She studies how your belly wobbles and jiggles for a second before looking at you and smiling. “I think most of this is new. I’m not sure whether to call you a good piggy or a naughty piggy for getting so fat.” She leans back, standing up right.  

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-look.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

She places her right hand on her hip, letting her left hand hang passively. “You really should be careful, I’d hate for you to break even more furniture. It’s expensive to replace and that money is better invested in more edible assets in my humble opinion.” She gives you a little smile before turning and walking out of the door, leaving you alone in your room waiting somewhat patiently for your feast. 

Several minutes later you hear the sounds of metal wheels and footsteps growing closer. The sounds grow closer before finally reaching your door. Turning you see Gabriel open the door, holding it open as four servants bring in the carts, leaving them next to your table before they leave. Gabriela walks over to you, her gazing wandering over the vast assortment of food loaded onto the carts. “I don’t think that all of this is going to fit onto the table. Hmm.” She thinks for a moment, putting her hand on her chin. “I know, I’ll just slide the table away from you and put the carts right in front of you.” 

She walks over, grabbing the edge of the wooden table and with a bit of effort moves it away from you, making just enough room to slide one cart in front of you. She moves the other cart along the side of your chair, allowing you to reach every item placed on the carts. “Alright, looks like you can reach everything. Enjoy piggy, and just ring the belly when you’re done and someone will come and clean up the mess you’ll inevitably make.” With that Gabriela exits your room, leaving you by yourself with the feast to devour. 

The sheer amount of food before you is simply overwhelming to say the least. The variety alone is awetaking but the amount of it is intimidating to say the least. You recognize a few dishes, ribs, beef roast, pork chops, fried chicken, duck, mashed potatoes with gravy, cheesy carrots, cornbread and honey, dinner rolls, stew, soup, lamb chops, buttery corn, pork tenderloin, and several other dishes. That&#39;s the contents on one cart. The dessert cart has a similar variety with it containing cheesecake, chocolate cake, donuts, eclairs, chocolate covered croissants, angel cake, fruit cake, pudding, and a few other desserts.     

The feeling of being overwhelmed quickly fades and hunger sets in. You feel your mouth start to drool and your stomach rumble thinking about eating everything in front of you. You feel your lust for food growing stronger and stronger. You grab a handful of fried chicken and shove it into your maw, the grease and crumbs getting all over your face. The fried chicken is wonderful and only adds fuel to the fire. You alternate between foods, grabbing handfuls of food and shoving it into your mouth like a feral animal. Quickly every dish starts to evaporate as you make your way through every dish. You grab the bowl of mashed potatoes and dump gravy all over them before shoveling the hot creamy, and slightly salty, potatoes drenched in savory gravy into your mouth. The bowl quickly empties and you lick your fingers clean before moving onto the honey covered cornbread and juicy pork tenderloin, the two items counteracting each other keeping your mouth fairly wet. Next, feeling a little thirsty you move onto the soup. Bringing the bowl to your lips, you drink the soup in one go. Before you even have time to process what you’re doing you dive into the stew and dinner rolls. Shoving a whole roll in your mouth before taking a large swig of stew like it was water.  

With the first cart&#39;s food beginning to dwindle you become aware of the growing fullness in your gut. You can feel how bloated and stuffed you&#39;re getting. Looking down you can see that your stomach is visibly stretched out slightly from how much food you’ve eaten. You also notice how much food is on you. You’re covered in drops of grease and soup, coated in crumbs and little bits of meat and your face is slathered in food. Honestly though, you like how it feels to be a dirty pig.

Digging back into your feast you waste no time in polishing off the last remaining morsels of food that are left on the first cart. Not stopping for a break you shift your attention to the dessert cart. You stuff your face with handfuls of dense cheesecake, rich chocolate cake, sugarly donuts, creamy eclairs, tasty croissants, thich pudding and much more. You honestly start to lose yourself as the growing fullness in your belly increases and you feel your mind get foggy. You feel yourself fall into a haze of eating, burping and eating. You don’t stop for breaks, you only eat. Handful after handful you feel your belly become painfully full. You can’t stop yourself, you’re not really even aware of what&#39;s happening. Every bite is worth the pain in your belly, though you rather like the pain of fullness.  

You eventually regain your senses and find that the other two carts have been picked clean. Your hands have been seeming licked clean and most of the food has been removed from your breasts and face. At least in your haze you made sure to clean them, though you probably just knew what was on them. You’re slouched back in your chair, you go to sit up but the fullness in your gut prevents you from doing so. With a burp and a groan you lean back in your chair and rest for a few moments.

Now fully decided what you want to have to eat you wait for the servant you summoned to make their way up to your room. After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?” 

“I think I&#39;ll have a small meal. Some grilled chicken, a salad and maybe some soup should be good.”

“Just a small meal?” Gabrelia raises an eyebrow and cocks her head to one side. “Are you sure? That seems like such a small, tiny, unfilling meal. I know I’d need sooooo much more than that!” She gets her point across and grabs her belly giving it a good jiggle. You watch as the fat underneath jiggles and bounces under her dress. You can’t take your eyes off her wonderful jiggling gut. “Eyes up here, My Lady.” You blush and Gabrelia gives you a smug smile. “Now, how about I get you a bigger meal, something to fill your own &lt;&lt;if $player.lbsT gte 300 and $player.lbsT lt 400&gt;&gt;big&lt;&lt;ifelse $player.lbsT gte 400 and $player.lbsT lt 500&gt;&gt;massive&lt;&lt;ifelse $player.lbsT gte 500 and $player.lbsT lt 600&gt;&gt; gigantic&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; belly.” She says poking you in the gut with her finger, making you blush.

&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabrelia’s smile fades a bit, you can tell that she’s mildly annoyed but she&#39;s quick to recover. “Of course, My Lady.” With that she turns and starts to leave your bedroom to head down to get your meal. You watch her as she passes you, your eyes locked on her belly. It jiggles slightly under her dress with every step. 

She&#39;s gone for just a few minutes before returning carrying a tray. She walks over to the table and sets it down. The tray has a grilled chicken breasts on it, a salad with vegetables and other things that are green, and a bowl of hot onion soup. “Enjoy.” She says evenly, no hint of actual emotion in her voice. With that she leaves the room, leaving you to enjoy your meager meal. 

You quickly eat your small meal, which barely fills you up but at least it&#39;s healthy. Maybe you should have taken her offer to have more. Oh well, you can always order more food you guess.

Gabrielas smile widens into a full on devilish grin of a devious vixen. “Right away my hungry piggy-Queen. I’ll make sure your gut is stuffed.” With that she turns and starts to leave your bedroom to head down to get your meal. You watch her as she passes you, your eyes locked on her belly. It jiggles slightly under her dress with every step. 

She&#39;s gone for just a few minutes before returning carrying a large tray. She walks over to the table and sets it down. The tray is covered with tons of food, all of which looks incredibly unhealthy. A large plate in the middle of the tray has about half a dozen breaded and fried chicken breasts, a large bowl to the left of the chicken is filled with steaming mac’n’cheese and to the right is an entire tray of brownies. “I do hope this is enough for you, My Lady. I wouldn’t want you wasting away.” She eyes you for a moment before leaving you to this feast before you. 

The hot smell of the greasy, recently fried chicken breasts fill your nose with their tantalizing scent, begging you to eat them. The mac&#39;n&#39;cheese divides your attention from the chicken, its delicious smell demanding that you devour the whole bowl. Finally the aroma of the fudge brownies dares you to eat them first. With your belly now rubbing with the pains of hunger you decide to dive into the feast in front of you.

You grab one of the still hot chicken breasts and shove it into your hungry maw. You bite into it with a satisfying crunch, the oil and grease from the chicken pour into your mouth. It’s one of the most delicious things you’ve ever eaten. You waste no time eating all the other fried breasts before turning your ravenous gaze onto the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese. Grabbing a spoon you shovel some into your mouth, the hot cheese and noodles seems to melt into a cheesy wonderful flavor. You shovel the tasty food into your mouth as fast as your arm can move. The bowl empties at an incredible speed leaving only the bowines left. You grab a brownie and shove it into your mouth, crumbs getting everywhere as you do so, the fudge flavor explodes in your mouth. You chew it with incredible speed and swallow it before shoving another in your mouth, and another, and another until they’re all gone. 

You can feel crumbs and grease, and mac’n’cheese, all over your lips and cleavage. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 6&gt;&gt; You let out a loud, long drawn out burp. You move your tongue around your lips as best you can trying to get every morsel of food. You lick the grease off your fingers before using them to pick the crumbs off of your breasts and bring them to your still hungry maw&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Grabbing a napkin you wipe the grease off your fingers before cleaning off your face and lips, as well as your cleavage. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“What does my lady wish to eat today?” 

“I think I&#39;ll have a small meal. Surprise me”

Gabrielas smile widens into a full on devilish grin of a devious vixen. “Right away my hungry piggy-Queen. I’ll make sure your gut is stuffed.” With that she turns and starts to leave your bedroom to head down to get your meal. You watch her as she passes you, your eyes locked on her belly. It jiggles slightly under her dress with every step. 

A few minutes later she returns carrying a huge tray and right behind her another servant carrying another tray of the same size. They set down the trays on the table, once done the other servant leaves. The two trays are filled with food. On one tray there&#39;s a well seasoned roast with various cooked vegetables around it, along with the roast there&#39;s a bowl of gravy and mashed potatoes, as well as a good number of rolls with plenty of butter on them. The second tray seems to be just a dessert tray. It has a chocolate cake, an apple pie and a large number of cookies.    

You raise an eyebrow and look at Gabriela who’s smile quickly fades to confusion. “Is something wrong, My Lady? You did ask for a large meal didn’t you?”

“I asked for a small meal.”

“Ohhhh, silly me, I must have misheard you. You know just how terrible my hearing is. Well, I mean you might as well eat it since it’s all been made, right?”

   &lt;/div&gt;   
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabriela’s smile remains unfazed. “Sounds good, just tell me what you want and I’ll put them on this tray and I’ll take everything else on the other.” She stands ready, eagerly awaiting you to tell her what you want. 

“I’ll have a few slices of the roast, some mashed potatoes, gravy, some rolls, a slice of pie and cake and some cookies.” She moves quickly to slice off some thick pieces of roast for you, serves out a hearty serving of mashed potatoes and covers them with gravy, as well as leaving you some rolls and butter. She gives you three cookes, and a large slice of cake and pie.  

With all of your food served out to you Gabriela piles everything else on the other tray. “It looks like everything is set out for you, enjoy, My Lady.” She picks up the tray and makes her way to the door, she pauses at the door frame and looks back at you for a second before leaving. 

The hot smell of the food fills your nose with its delight. You feel your stomach rubble and your mouth start to salivate at the idea of stuffing all of it into your maw. You grab a slice of meat with your fork and bring it to your mouth. The roast is juicy and perfectly seasoned, it’s tender and breaks apart in your mouth. You quickly devour the first piece of meat before grabbing the second and just as quickly devouring it. Every tender bite fills your mouth with a wonderful juice and grease. Moving quickly you shovel spoonfuls of gravy covered mashed potatoes into your devouring maw. The salty mashed potatoes mix well with the savory gravy. As you shovel food into your mouth you can feel drops of grease and gravy stain your lips and cleavage. With the pile of mashed potatoes gone you move onto the dinner rolls. You cover them with butter and start to shove them into your mouth. Quickly the number of rolls starts to dwindle before you finish them off, butter covering your hands and finger. With all of the dinner items finished off you move onto the desert. The rich chocolate cake is eaten in mere moments, honestly you ate it so fast you barely could taste it. The apple pie meets a similar fate, followed quickly by the cookies. With everything gone you feel pretty stuffed. You have no idea if you could have even eaten all of the food she had brought to begin with. 

Leaning back in your seat you take a moment to rest. You can feel butter and grease all over your hands, fingers, face and breasts. Crumbs from the cookies and pie have stuck to your lips and cleavage. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 5&gt;&gt; You lick your tongue around your lips, trying to get every morsel of grease and every crumb. Next you use your hands to clean off your cleavage as best you can, you even try to lick the grease and butter off of them. Finally you give your fingers and hands a good licking, making sure to get every drop of butter. You give your overstuffed gut a little pat, which causes you to let out a loud burp. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Grabbing a napkin you go about cleaning off your disgusting face, sometimes you eat like a pig you think to yourself. Next you clean off your cleavage and finally you give your hands a good wipe down. You give your overstuffed gut a little pat, it feels so full, why did you eat so much?&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Now fully decided what you want to have to eat you wait for the servant you summoned to make their way up to your room. After about a minute or two of waiting you hear footsteps echo through the hallway and a few moments later the door opens to your room. Though the now open door steps the bottom heavy Gabriela. She spots you sitting and smiles a smug little smile. She walks over and stands near you, ready to hear what you want to eat. 

“What does my lady wish to eat today?” 

“Hmm, I think a nice filling meal today. Something normal. I think I’ll have a steak, medium rare, some green beans and a slice of cheesecake for dessert.” 

Gabriela’s smile fades a little and she puts her finger on her cheek and tilts her head. “Just a steak, some green beans and just a single slice of cheesecake? Wouldn’t you like something a little more fat-filling? Sorry, I ment filling. Sometimes I mince my words.” She lets out a little chuckle. “So, would you like something a little more filling, My Lady?”

      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabriela’s smile further fades before she cracks a fuller smile. “I don’t know how you get away with eating so little, My Lady.” She taps her belly, making it jiggle. “I know I couldn’t eat so little, especially not with a gut like this…” She lets out a sigh. “Well I better get that food for you.” She turns and starts to walk away before stopping halfway to the door and turning back to look at you. She reaches back and gives her ass a slap while looking at you, making sure you can see it jiggle. “Though eating extra has given me this nice ass, maybe it’d do the same for you. So long as you don’t become too much more like a pig.” With that she continues walking to the door, you watch her ass jiggle and bounce. While you&#39;re not sure about you having a big ass you definitely love her big jiggly ass, even if it is attached to a woman who constantly judges and embarrasses you.

A few minutes later she returns with a tray in hand. She sets it down on the table in front of you. On the tray is a perfect medium rare steak, a bowl of buttered green beans and a large slice of cheesecake. She looks at the tray for a minute and shakes her head. “Well, enjoy.” She says before walking away, under her breath you can just barely hear her utter something. “Why do the fattest and most pathetic pigs always try to resist? Stupid piggy, I’ll…” As she walks out of the room her voice becomes inaudible.  

Not sure what she was talking about, and not really trying to think about what she might be up to. Instead you focus on the meal that sits before you. Your mouth starts salivating at the smell of the food. The steak looks perfect, it even seems it&#39;s been basted in butter as you can still see hot butter dripping off of it, oozing between the slices of the steak. Grabbing a fork you grab one of the slices and put the hot meat in your mouth. The meat is so tender it seems to almost melt in your mouth, the buttery goodness coating your tongue. You quickly scarfe down the rest of your steak and move onto the buttered green beans. The green beans are savory and salty, but really nothing more than a filler, like something a lazy writer would add in to occupy the reader until the actual plot continues. With the green beans quickly gone your hungry gaze turns to the cheese cake. You take your fork and load it up with a large piece and shove the dese cake into your mouth. The cool creamy goodness of the cheesecake fills your mouth as you chew it. You love how the crunch of the crust compliments the creamy delight of the cake. You feel yourself lose control and you stuff every bite of cheesecake into your mouth. Before you even realise it the cheesecake is gone, leaving you with a desire for even more. Maybe you should order some more food?

Gabriela’s smile widens as she hears your response to have a little more. “I’m glad you have decided to embrace how much of a true piggy you are. Just try not to get so fat you break that chair… without me around. I’d hate to not have the chance to see that big fat ass crush a chair. Well I better get food for my fat pig.” She turns and starts to walk away before stopping halfway to the door and turning back to look at you. She reaches back and gives her ass a slap while looking at you, making sure you can see it jiggle. “Though eating extra has given me this nice ass, but unlike you I can stop stuffing my face after I’ve had me fill. You’ll just keep growing and growing, like such a naughty piggy.” While you’re not a fan of her calling you a pig watching her massive ass jiggle and wobble is more than enough to take your mind off what she said.  

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-chibi-exit-rear.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

A few minutes later she returns with a tray in hand. She sets it down on the table in front of you. On the tray are three perfect medium rare steaks, a large bowl of heavily buttered green beans and a cheesecake. “I went ahead and got you a little more dessert.” She says gesturing to the cheesecake. “I’d hate it if my naughty piggy starved. Eat up piggy.” She says before walking away.

Your mouth starts salivating at the smell of the food. The steaks look perfect, it even seems they’ve been basted in butter as you can still see hot butter dripping off of it, oozing between the slices of the steaks. Grabbing a fork you grab one of the slices and put the hot meat in your mouth. The meat is so tender it seems to almost melt in your mouth, the buttery goodness coating your tongue. You quickly scarfe down the first steak before moving onto the second and the third before turning your hunger to the green beans. The green beans are savory and salty, but really nothing more than a filler, like something a lazy writer would add in to occupy the reader until the actual plot continues. With the green beans quickly gone your hungry gaze turns to the cheesecake. You take your fork and load it up with a large piece and shove the dese cake into your mouth. The cool creamy goodness of the cheesecake fills your mouth as you chew it. You love how the crunch of the crust compliments the creamy delight of the cake. You feel yourself lose control and you stuff every bite of cheesecake into your mouth. You practically inhale the cheesecake as it’s gone within a few minutes, leaving you with a full and heavy gut. 

Sitting back in your chair you can feel that you’re pretty full and you can feel some butter on your breasts and cheesecake on your face. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 6&gt;&gt; You lick your lips off as best you can before trying to lick the butter off of your breasts, which isn’t particularly effective but you do manage to get some of it. With your body now being mostly devoid of food you start rubbing your belly. Your rubbing extracts a few burps from you that you shameless let out. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Grabbing a napkin you wipe down your face and breasts, making sure to clean yourself up properly. With your face clean you decided to rub your belly. As you rub a small burp comes out from you. You quickly cover your mouth and turn red before looking around to make sure no one saw you. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“What does my lady wish to eat today?” 

“Hmm, I think a nice filling meal today. Something normal. I’m not totally sure what I’m feeling so it surprises me.”

Gabriela’s smile widens. “Of course, My lady. I’ll get you something nice and fattening right away!” Without skipping a beat she turns and walks towards the door. She stops halfway and turns to look over her shoulder at you. She gives her ass a little slap. You watch as the fat jiggles and bounces. Gabriela chuckles which draws your eyes from her ass to her face. “Such a pervy piggy! You know piggy if you didn’t stuff yourself you could have a nice juicy ass like mine, too bad your eating habits control you. You wouldn’t want to get a flabby, cottage cheese ass, would you piggy? Well, I better get that food for you, My Piggy.” With that she continues to the door, every step causing her ass to wobble and jiggle before it disappears out of sight as she exits the room. 

A few minutes later Gabriela returns with a small cart packed full of food. She wheels it over to the table and starts to unload dish after dish of food onto the table. There are plates of meats, you see a beef roast, steaks, pork tenderloin, grilled chicken. There are plates of vegetables, you see cheesy carrots, gravy covered mashed potatoes and some butter drenched corn. Finally you see several plates of desert, a cheese cake, a chocolate cake, a plate of maybe a dozen sugar donuts, a tray of brownies and a plate of cookies. The amount of food laid out in front of you is a literal feast. You raise an eyebrow as you look at the table full of food in front of you. 

“Something wrong? You did say to surprise you.” Gabriela says with a smug little grin. “Well, I guess it is a bit much. If you don’t want to eat all of it, or I should say if you can resist eating all of it, just take what you want and I’ll get rid of the rest.”

   &lt;/div&gt;   
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;
Gabriela seems unfazed by your response, she just nods her head and waits for you to decide what you want from the huge feast. You take a moment looking at all the dishes placed in front of you. You feel yourself growing hungrier looking at all the steaming hot food and the delicious smell filling your nose. Gosh, you really want all of it, but you already made your choice. 

“I’ll have some beef roast, a cut up steak, a grilled chicken breast, a good helping of carrots, potatoes and corn. I’ll have a slice of each cake, two brownies and two cookies.” Geez, that&#39;s still a ton of food but you’re so hungry you want to eat it all so badly.  

“Of course, My Pigyy.” Gabriela moves quickly. She grabs a large, empty plate from the cart and fills it with everything you asked for. Once your food has been dished up she packs everything back onto the little cart. “Enjoy.” She says before wheeling the cart out of the room and leaving you to your plate overflowing with food. 

With your plate so full of food you decide it best to just eat some of everything all at once. Fork in hand you start to shove bite after bite of food into your mouth. First some roast, then some tender buttery steak, a quick bite of cheesy carrots, half a brownie, some corn and then some chicken. You eat at a breakneck speed. You feel so full yet so hungry and you just can’t stop. You eat and eat, food getting all over your face and cleavage. You feel your belly growing fuller with every bite, but you don’t stop, you need to keep eating and stuffing yourself. You feel like such a pig as you stuff bite after bite into your maw. Before you even realise it the plate of food is gone.

You lean back, your belly painfully full from your little feast. You can feel food covering your lips and cleavage from you pigging out. &lt;&lt;if $player.slobbyness gt 5&gt;&gt; You greedily lick the food from your face and lips as best you can, desperate to get it all into your overstuffed gut. Next you try your best to lick your breasts clean, using your hands to help as best you can. With your breasts and face as clean as one might expect from licking them clean you lean back and start to rub your gut. Burp after burp escapes your lips as you rub your stuffed gut, filling the room with the sounds of guttonly. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Grabbing a napkin you wipe off your face and try your best to get all the food and grease out of your cleavage. You lean back in your chair and rub your gut, a few small burps escape your lips but you&#39;re too full and stuffed to care at the moment.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Gabriela seems unfazed by your response. You take a moment looking at all the dishes placed in front of you. You feel yourself growing hungrier looking at all the steaming hot food and the delicious smell filling your nose. You can’t wait to eat all of it, even if you know that you’ll end up with a very, very overfilled gut. 

Gabriela takes the cart and leaves the room, halfway to the door she stops and turns to look at you. “Enjoy, you fat pig.” She says before turning away and leaving the room. You don’t bother to watch her go, you&#39;re fixed on the feast in front of you. You can’t wait to eat everything.  

The first thing you dig into is the roast, your fork practically sheds it due to how tender the meat is and due to how fast you shoving it into your maw. The savory greasy meat is devoured within a minute, a roast that could feed a family is downed by you in minutes. Next you move onto the steaks, lucky they&#39;re already pre-cut so you waste no time devouring the buttery goodness of the steaks. They almost seem to melt in your mouth, well, they would but you&#39;re eating so fast that they don’t really have time to do anything other than be ripped to shreds by your teeth before being dragged down to your stomach. With the steaks gone in a matter of moments you move onto the grilled chicken. The sweet chicken is gone and down your maw in just a few seconds. Next up is the cheesy carrots, followed by the mashed potatoes and washed down with some butter drenched corn. At this point you feel so stuffed and full, but then you see the cakes and forget all about how full you are.

You grab the cheesecake and start shoveling fork full after fork full into your mouth of the dense cheesecake. You can feel the cheesecake getting all over you but you don’t care. You decide to forgo the fork as it’s not getting enough cake itn your face as what you’d like. You grab handfuls of cake and shove it into your face, getting crumbs everywhere. Finally the cake is gone and you move onto the brownies and cookies. Your belly is already painfully full but you don’t stop, it all tastes so good. 

At some point you lose focus, like you&#39;re running on autopilot. When you regain your senses you find that everything has been devoured and you’re covered in food with a painfully full gut. Even with the pain in your belly you slowly lick off the food from your face and fingers before picking off any food in your cleavage as best you can. You’re desperate to get every bite into your mouth. Content with being slightly less dirty you start rubbing your overstuffed gut, letting out deafening burps and belches as you rub your poor belly. You don’t care how much of a slob you look and sound like right now, you’re too full to care. You’ll clean yourself up and feel embarrassed later, maybe.

You give it a few tugs, rigging a bell in the servant quarters far down below. A servant will be up in a few moments, in the meantime you should decide what you want to eat.

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt;   Danrica Laz-Hferr is a dwarvish woman currently working as one of your servants. She is quite dumb, to put it simply. In fact her intelligence, or lack of it, is her most obvious trait right behind her large breasts. She is a total airhead and pretty much oblivious to everything and anything that happens around, and to her. You’re honestly not sure how she got the job as one of your stop servants, but here she is. Your parents always told you it was because it was her “destiny” and would then snicker to themselves. After becoming queen you discovered that a dwarf family paid your parents handsomely to take her off their hands to make sure she never returned. Most people in the castle like her, so long as they don’t have to deal with her in any way that requires any form of thinking or talking on her part, though she manages to mess up whatever task she’s given so it’s hardly worth even expecting the task to be done correctly. What she lacks in brains she makes up for in pride. She’s constantly boasting about how great dwarfs are, often contributing inventions or creations to them that just weren&#39;t made or found by them. The only thing people like about her, though a lot of people don’t like it, is how she “flirts”. “Flirts” is a strong word as she more so just lists off things that she finds attractive about you and how it makes her feel. She has pretty much to drive after that as she neither makes any more advances or realizes that other people are making advances towards her. Poor Henry never seems to learn.   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Gabriela Storenson is a human woman currently employed as one of your personal servants. She is quite intelligent and completes all of her tasks well. She is known for being quite mischievous. Often her mischief manifests in her bringing more portions of food than requested or offering garments that are too small for you to wear. Her depths of mischief go far beyond you however. She enjoys having power over people, particularly their weight. While you can’t think of any cases of her mischief adding more than the odd few pounds to any female servant that works with her, you wouldn’t exactly put the notion that she wouldn’t go further off the table. Gabriela herself is a fairly big girl, this seems to stem from her own personal love for cooking and she seems to genuinely enjoy her size as she goes to great lengths to neither gain or lose weight. While most girls her size would have confidence issues Gabriela makes sure you can see every curve and she makes sure that you know that she knows she’s attractive. She seems to love teasing guards and male servants with her body, especially if they seem disgusted by it, unfortunately for the boys who like her body she only has a sexual interest in women. Females get a different treatment however. You’ve seen her play coy with girls and flirt with them and then she’ll follow that up by embarrassing them or shaming them. Along with this Gabriela has a particular interest in physically making her targets uncomfortable, whether it&#39;s grabbing a belly, slapping a fatter ass or squeezing a pair of expanding breasts she does it all. You’re not sure how many women she’s hooked up with but judging by her actions it&#39;s probably been a few. She’s an odd one to be sure.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box-container-R&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt; Dranaria was born deep under the earth in a dwarven stronghold. She grew up surrounded by craftsmen of unequal skill. Her early years as a young dwarf would have been spent learning the trades trying to find her place in life. Her father was a very successful miner and wished for her to join him in the mines, however after Danrica nearly caused a collapse that almost destroyed the whole stronghold it was decided to never let her near a pickaxe or explosives again. So they sent her to train to work as a smith, unfortunately that didn’t last too long either as she managed to destroy the whole stronghold smithy, encasing it in a solid layer of liquid steel. At this point she spent the next 35 years as the stronghold&#39;s official mushroom tester. What a mushroom test is you’re not sure of, but Dranaria described it as a very technical and important job which kept her confined to a secluded area of the stronghold. In all likelihood they just didn’t want her breaking anything else. After she managed to fail at this job and accidentally woke up a red dragon that destroyed much of the stronghold she was “banished”. They told her that the red dragon was a sign of a prophecy and that she must leave and never return, so they sent her to your kingdom. In reality her father, and a few other dwarfs even chipped in, to pay your parents to take her in as a servant and keep her there.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  Gabriela grew up in Ohneo Forest, a large forested area near the Ohneo river. Her parents managed the storehouse in the village, giving Gabriela near unlimited access to food. When she was in her late teens, nearly an adult, she took a liking to the daughter of the village leader. After the village leader found out about Gabriela and his daughter&#39;s relationship she was forced out of the village. Gabriela wondered for some time before eventually making her way to the capital. Here she worked as an alchemist assistant for a short time before being suddenly fired for some unknown and “Non-work related issue” as Gabriela put it. After that she worked as a cook in a tavern, which is where she found her love of the culinary delights. She worked at the tavern, the fat hog, for about a year before applying for a job at the castle, with her ultimate goal to become the castle cook, though she seems to also have found an odd passion for working as a servant recently.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt; Dranaria has some interesting preferences to say the least. When it comes to food she enjoys things on the more savory and filling side, with sweets being her second favorite things to eat. Sexually you’re not sure about her. She seems to enjoy both men and women, though since her time at the castle you’ve never actually seen her with either. She claims to have only ever had male dwarf lovers. When it comes to her body she has no cares in the world. She is unfazed by any weight gain or lose or anything else. Her clothing is much the same, so long as it, mostly, fits she doesn’t really care. You really have to wonder if her lack of caring is due to her sheer stupidity or if she’s just really good at rolling with the punches of life, or maybe she really doesn&#39;t care. One thing Dranaria does however deeply care about is craftsmanship. Surprisingly she is incredible at telling the quality of metallurgy and she absolutely refuses to be near or use anything that doesn’t meet her standards. However her ability to tell quality does not translate to an ability to produce quality goods, not by a long shot.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

Gabriela has very few preferences in life, or at least she’s good at hiding them. One preference she is very open about however is her love for large women, very large women. It really seems to be her only motivator in life honestly. She loves to oogle at every inch of fat as her, or any, girl waddles by. What she loves more than that is adding a few more inches of fat to her current pig. The thing she loves most of all though is making sure that her pig knows that she is nothing more than a fat pig who has to listen and do anything that Gabriela says. When she’s not fattening up her current pig she’s working at her next culinary creation. She keeps a little booklet with her at all times and writes down any new ideas or edits she thinks of. She keeps a separate booklet, the purpose of it is unknown to you however. Other than that Gabriela seems to take interest in nothing else, no friends, no hobbies, nothing.  
 &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box-container-R&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt; Dwarfs are a race of humanoids that are short and stocky. They are well built and sturdy, well adept at living deep under the earth in their stone strongholds. They are a very traditional race and prefer to keep to themselves besides trading. They are known to be amazing craftsmen with no equal. Anything made by a dwarf will stay in good shape for a lifetime, or more correctly lifetimes, dwarf lifetimes.  Dwarfs usually live 250 years but some have been known to live longer, one Dwarf that wasn’t an alcoholic even lived to be 900! Their long life spans usually mean they Dwarfs are slow reproducers, which in recent times has led to them declining as other races like humans take over their mountains. Overall much isn’t known about the particular group that Dranaria comes from, very little contact has ever been made or had with them.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Humans are the most common race by far, with them inhabiting every biome on earth. Humans are also the oldest known race, with ancient human structures being the oldest ever found. Humans are not the smartest, or the strongest, or, well, really the best at anything. What they are really good at is farming, and building and having lots of babies that go on to do the same. While some groups of humans are better at warfare, or farming, or having babies, each group of humans is distinct and dominates the biome they live in. While there at one point was race wars between the other races of the world, humans won pretty much all of them. The only thing that’s stopped the other races being wiped out is human men discovering that most races have tits or asses and that now other humans are the biggest competition. Different groups of humans look considerably different from each other with some groups offen falling into a sub or break off race of their own. Side note, humans are also well known for being one race that commonly interbreads with other races, creating unique mixes of races.   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;/switch&gt;&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt; Hjodlikziz, translating to Rocky, is the region that Dranaria hails from. The area is situated in a beautiful mountain range that separates the plains from the eastern coastline. While the mountains are as grand as the western mountains they make up for it in the plentiful resources that they provide. The name is kind of a misnomer as the area is actually hardly rocky as the mountains are mostly covered in dirt and trees. The dwarf who named it must have been drunk or playing some sort of dwarf joke, probably drunk. There is at least one dwarven stronghold in the region, but any other minor settlements or strongholds are unknown. Likewise the size of the dwarven stronghold is unknown. At one point in recent history it went toe-to-toe with a fully grown red dragon and came out on top, but the remaining strength of the stronghold is questionable. There is one human settlement in the area, it’s a border town under the control of the Philifigh confederacy.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;box-R2&quot;&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;box-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ohneo Forest is named after the nearby Ohneo river that runs from the north down to the south where it meets the Mistasipapi river to flow further south before reaching the ocean. The region is characterized by thickly wooded forests and large open flat fields. The region has been in your kingdom for about 500 years and is a deeply loyal region. There isn’t much heavy industry in the area beyond logging and farming. There are many small towns and villages in the area, but due to the aforementioned farming and logging there really aren&#39;t any large cities in the region. Ohneo Forest is about 30 miles east from the capital region, 30 miles past the border and you’ll reach the Ohneo river and the end of the Ohneo Forest. The area has a strong sense of tradition, every year in early September they have a great feast and festival that tends to last two or three days. It is often held in the capital and paid for by the ruler, you. &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img  class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src= &quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Dranaria/Dranaria-Average.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Dranaria is your air headed dwarven servant who has an uncanny ability to mess up any task she is given. She stands at the miniscule four feet eleven inches, placing her far shorter than most other races. She usually wears a blue silk dress and keeps her hair done up in a messy bun of curly hair held together by a gold clip. Speaking of gold she wears quite a bit of it. On her right ear she dons a gold earring and on her left hand she has a gold bracelet. 

Deciding to have a closer look at her you start by examining her hair. She has brown curly hair that&#39;s done up in a messy bun, you imagine that when she doesn’t have her hair done up she has something more like an afro. Her curls are small and tight, forming a dense and fluffy head of hair. 

Below Dranaria’s hair is her dopey face. She seems to take good care of her face with her having flawless caramel skin that seems to shine. Her eyes are a deep brown, however you can tell that there aren’t many thoughts behind those eyes. In other words, the lights are on but only the dog and cat are home. Her cheeks are cute and rounded, giving her a very approachable face. Her lips are almost constantly formed into a dimwitted half-smile, only making it more apparent that she is about as smart as a box of rocks. 

Her neck has no noteworthy features other than connecting her empty skull to her body. Her shoulders are what you’d expect from a woman of her disposition in life. They are neither soft nor defined. The same can be said of her upper and lower arms with her having neither a large amount of fat or muscle, though don’t be fooled she could swing a pickaxe just as hard as a man twice her size! Too bad she’d probably miss the rock and hit the man twice her size. Focusing on her build from a larger focal point you notice how wide her shoulders relative to the rest of her frame, and honestly even compared to the average woman. 

With your new larger focal point your eyes catch something much more interesting than her shoulder width or arm definition; breasts. Her breasts are massive compared to the rest of her and her upper body width makes them even more impressive. Each one looks to be about the size of her head, without the hair, which is incredible considering she&#39;s quite lean in physique. You can imagine that each one of her breasts is incredibly soft and squishy. You wonder how much bigger they might get if she were to, somehow, gain weight? 

Below her massive jugs is her pretty trim belly. While she doesn&#39;t have abs or anything of that sort she certainly doesn’t have the usual beer belly that you’d expect an alcoholic dwarf to have. Instead it&#39;s pretty flat with only a minor coating of fat on it. What doesn’t surprise you is the fact that her belly certainly has potential. You can imagine it getting big and fat threatening to rip through her dress. The best part of the scenario is that so long as her breasts remain larger than her stomach she probably won’t notice it hanging out.

Follow the curve of her sides down and you come to her hips, which are pretty average and not really noteworthy. They are pretty average in width and not particularly fat either, clearly she has a top heavy build. Her rear follows this lower body trend of being pretty average. It fills out her tight blue dress well enough but nothing you’d really call extraordinary. Honestly you just feel kind of dirty staring at her ass, especially after already staring at her breasts. Perv.

Overall Dranaria is pretty average, for her height, at the moment. Besides her large breasts and small stature she is a fairly plain individual. The only really interesting, or noteworthy trait, is her complete lack of intelligence. You wonder sometimes if she was dropped on her head as a child or if some children are just born that stupid. It’s honestly a miracle that she manages to walk up and down the stairs everyday. Honestly it’s a surprise she manages to breathe all on her own.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;imageoutline2&quot; src=&quot;Stuff/Background charaters/Gabrriela/Gabriela-look.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 

Gabriela is one of your personal servants, with her helping to dress you, bathe you and do pretty much anything you might need regarding your personal care. She’s a big girl in pretty much every way. She stands at an above average five eight and weights at least three-hundred pounds. Most of her weight is in her wide hips, thick thighs and meaty ass, with a bit of weight in her belly. Her breasts are about what you’d expect from a woman of her size and build. Her face and arms don’t have much in the way of fat, giving her a pear body shape. 

Her chestnut hair is done up in a nice bun in the back and bangs with a tuft of hair forming a widow&#39;s peak in the middle that hangs down to her nose. Her hair has a lot of attitude, which pairs well with Gabriela’s personality of being sassy, domineering and in charge. It looks like she takes good care of her hair, keeping it well kept and bushed. It&#39;s unadorned with any sort of flashy hair clips, leaving it to be beautifully simple. 

Below her hair is her rather sharp and well defined face. The first thing you note about Gabriela is her brown eyes. They, for the most part, have a very neutral, almost uninterested, gaze to them, though occasionally you’ve seen a gleen in her eyes of extreme passion. If the eyes are the windows into the soul then Gabriela must have her curtains drawn most of the time. Her cheeks are pleasantly round without giving her a fat face. Her jawline is decently sharp, which given how her body holds weight you aren’t surprised. Her lips are pretty plain, the only other thing of note about Gabriela is she seems to be a fairly sweaty gal. Her sweating makes sense when you consider her girth paired with the fact she probably spends a lot of time going up and down stairs. While she doesn’t sweat excessively it is enough to leave a visible shine to her olive brow, chest and back.  

Moving down to her neck you find that it, just like her face, has been spared from her weight, leaving it looking pretty thin. Her neck connects to the rest of her torso with a gentle curve as it melds into the outline of her body. Following that curve further it eventually comes to her shoulders. Her shoulders look about what you’d expect a shoulder to look like, maybe slightly beefier than your normal girl but that&#39;s probably just from her arms moving around her extra weight and carrying loads up and down stairs. 

Her arms are hidden under the flowing fabric of her dress, not really even filling out the sleeves. This inability to fill her sleeves gives you the impression that her arms, just like her neck and shoulders, are relatively thin. Her dress ends at her mid forearm, and indeed your assumptions about her arms seem to be correct as her forearm looks fairly thin. Moving down the length of her forearm you come to her hands. Her hands, as you could have guessed, look fairly slim without any real traces of fat present on them. 

Shifting your gaze from her arms to her chest your eyes immediately find their way to her round bosom. Her breasts are round and perky, although they aren’t particularly big, which is to be expected considering her body heavy shape. Her cleavage is hidden under the fabric of her dress, but you imagine that there isn’t much to speak of as Gabriela seems to prioritise comfort rather than appeal, at least she does for her smaller assets. Her breasts rest cozily atop her upper belly roll, making them look like they&#39;re there on a shelf for display. 

Speaking of her belly she has a robust double belly, with the upper roll supporting her breasts and the lower roll jiggling and bouncing whenever she walks. Her upper belly roll is considerably smaller than the lower roll but it makes up for it by supporting her bosom as well as sporting nice side rolls to either side of her rib cage. 

Dividing her two belly rolls is a narrow, thin trench that runs from her sides along her front where it meets at her belly button. One thing you note while looking at her belly is how tightly her dress hugs her body from just below her breasts down to her ass. You have a feeling that she’s had a dress deliberately fitted to hug her curves. As to why she’s had her dress fitted to hug her belly, hips and ass is not known to you. 

Her lower belly is massive, compared to its upper roll counterpart, with it stretching from her hips, where it forms thick love handles, around to her front where it hangs over her waist a little. This lower roll has a tendency to jiggle and bounce whenever she walks around. The tight fabric of the dress makes every jiggle and ripple visible. Gabriela seems to have no shame in her weight, instead flaunting it for all to see as she walks by, belly and all jiggling. 

Moving down to her hips the first thing you notice is just how wide they are, you honestly aren’t sure how she is able to so easily navigate some of the castle&#39;s more narrow doorways. Her hips are coated in a hearty layer of fat that jiggles and wobbles with every step. Her huge hips make for a great supporting structure for her thick thighs and girthy ass. 

Following the curve of her hips down wards to her thighs you see that the dress loosens up a bit as it reaches her lower thigh. The dress is still tight enough however to make out quite a few details of her deliciously thick thighs. Each one of her thighs has quite a bit of jiggle on it, but you can tell that under all that fat her legs are pretty strong, especially considering how much she has to lug her larger frame up and down the stairs.  

Her ass is by far her magnomopus. Its shape is fantastic and the way her dress clings to it there is little left to the imagination. Her ass juts out from her back forming a little ass shelf made out of jiggly fat. You can imagine her massive rear wobbling and rippling with every step as she moves around the castle. You honestly love having a servant with such a robust build, it makes every meal dinner and a show.  

Overall Gabriela is quite the large woman, but don’t let that fool you she isn’t the type of fatty who sits around on her ass all day. She may be quite overweight but she still has quite a lot of physical ability under all that weight. It seems that both her behavior and physical build are quite interesting and raises more questions you have about the enigmatic women you call your servant. </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
